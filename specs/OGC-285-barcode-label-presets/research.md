# Research: OGC-285 Barcode Labels v2 — Configurable Label Preset Management

**Last updated:** 2026-05-19 (after `/speckit.clarify` + `/speckit.plan`)
**FRS source of truth pin:** [`7cf6f65cae9a9794e52f3dd4c5e759c920d87bf5`](https://github.com/DIGI-UW/openelis-work/blob/7cf6f65cae9a9794e52f3dd4c5e759c920d87bf5/designs/admin-config/barcode-labels.md)

## 1. Canonical FRS pin (snapshot discipline)

The OGC-285 engineering contract pins the upstream FRS at a
specific commit SHA in the `DIGI-UW/openelis-work` repository. This is
deliberate: the FRS is a separate, design-owned artifact that evolves on
its own schedule, and the engineering spec needs an unambiguous source
of truth that cannot drift silently.

**Current pin:**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Repository | `DIGI-UW/openelis-work` |
| Path | `designs/admin-config/barcode-labels.md` |
| SHA | `7cf6f65cae9a9794e52f3dd4c5e759c920d87bf5` |
| FRS version | v2.5 |
| Date pinned | 2026-05-19 17:45 UTC |
| Commit message | `chore(admin-config): rename barcode-labels-v2 → barcode-labels, update to v2.5` |
| openelis-work HEAD at pin time | `49de90d807b0ef44865202acb54aa18f126ff299` |

URL: https://github.com/DIGI-UW/openelis-work/blob/7cf6f65cae9a9794e52f3dd4c5e759c920d87bf5/designs/admin-config/barcode-labels.md

### Pin discipline protocol

The pin discipline is the only authorized path for FRS changes to enter
this engineering contract. The protocol:

1. **Detect drift.** On every spec PR, the reviewer confirms whether the
   upstream `barcode-labels.md` has moved beyond the pinned SHA. Use:

   ```bash
   gh api 'repos/DIGI-UW/openelis-work/commits?path=designs/admin-config/barcode-labels.md&per_page=1' \
     --jq '.[0].sha'
   ```

2. **Bump the SHA.** If a newer SHA exists, update the SHA in this
   research.md, [spec.md](./spec.md) frontmatter, [plan.md](./plan.md)
   and References.

3. **Diff the FRS.** Generate a diff between old and new SHA:

   ```bash
   gh api 'repos/DIGI-UW/openelis-work/compare/{OLD_SHA}...{NEW_SHA}' \
     --jq '.files[] | select(.filename == "designs/admin-config/barcode-labels.md") | .patch'
   ```

4. **Reconcile.** Walk the diff against the in-repo spec.md FRs and
   acceptance criteria; update any FR whose source FRS clause changed.

5. **Commit atomically.** The SHA bump + reconciliation lands in a
   single PR.

This is intentionally a manual process. Automating it would risk silent
spec drift — the opposite of the discipline OGC-285 was designed to
avoid.

## 2. Resolved FRS Open Questions

The FRS v2.5 records four open questions in §11. Resolutions locked in
spec.md; full rationale below.

### Q1 — Snapshot vs current preset for reprint

**FRS text** (§11 Q1):
> Do we need a "label-template-version" column on `order_label_request`
> so reprint can choose between snapshot-at-save vs current preset?
> Snapshot is the safer default; some sites may want "always use current".

**Decision:** Snapshot only for v2.
**Rationale:**
- AC-20 is the canonical statement; making it configurable would
  invalidate AC-20.
- Audit integrity outweighs operational convenience. Pathology,
  regulatory environments, and chain-of-custody tracking depend on
  label-as-printed matching order-as-shown.
- Implementation simplicity: one code path. Adding a per-site or
  per-reprint toggle doubles the reprint test matrix and adds an
  `order_label_request.template_version` column.
- No real customer has asked for "use current preset on reprint" —
  this is a hypothetical Q from the design author, not a stakeholder request.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Per-site toggle (`site_information.barcode.reprint_mode` = `SNAPSHOT` |
  `CURRENT`). Rejected: same code path doubling, no demand.
- Per-reprint user choice. Rejected: surfaces too many decisions at the
  reprint moment; admin should set policy, not technician.

**Deferred to v3+:** If a real site requests "use current preset on
reprint", add an `order_label_request.template_version` column with
values `SNAPSHOT_FROZEN` (default) and `LIVE_FROM_PRESET`.

### Q2 — Allow-override toggle home

**FRS text** (§11 Q2):
> What's the right home for the "Allow label count override at order
> entry" master toggle — per-test (current proposal), per-lab, or both?

**Decision:** Per-test only (no per-lab layer in v2).
**Rationale:**
- The 2-layer precedence (per-link + per-test master) handles common
  + gradient cases without a third layer.
- Lab-wide lockdown is rare-but-real; the right tool today is a SQL
  bulk update across `test_label_config.allow_order_entry_override`.
- Three-layer precedence increases bug surface (6 interaction modes
  vs 3).
- YAGNI: no deployed site has requested a per-lab toggle.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Per-lab master toggle stored in `site_information.barcode.override_disabled`.
  Rejected: most-restrictive-wins logic across 3 layers is harder to
  reason about; no demand.
- Per-link only (no per-test master). Rejected: makes test-level
  lockdown require N edits (one per linked preset); the per-test
  master is the right granularity for compliance scenarios.

**Deferred to v3+:** If a real stakeholder asks for lab-wide lockdown,
a third layer slots above `test_label_config` with the same most-
restrictive precedence rule.

### Q3 — A11y drag-drop for content fields

**FRS text** (§11 Q3):
> How do we handle accessibility for the drag-handle on content fields
> when the user is dragging? Carbon doesn't ship a fully a11y drag-drop;
> do we use react-aria's useDrag or roll our own keyboard-only fallback?

**Decision:** Keyboard Arrow Up/Down + native HTML5 drag for mouse.
**Rationale:**
- Keyboard navigation is a hard requirement (FR-032). Arrow Up /
  Arrow Down on the focused row covers screen-reader-only users.
- Native HTML5 drag works for mouse users; the visual affordance
  (drag handle icon) plus native browser behavior covers pointer
  users.
- react-aria adds bundle size + dependency risk for one component.

**Alternatives considered:**
- react-aria `useDrag` / `useDrop`. Rejected: dependency cost, learning
  curve, only used in this one component.
- Custom React hook for keyboard reorder. Same approach as Decision
  but written from scratch. Rejected: re-invents standard browser
  behavior.

**Deferred to v3+:** If a WCAG 2.2 AA audit flags drag-handle issues,
revisit with react-aria or similar a11y drag library.

### Q4 — Future custom-field shape (v3+ planning)

**FRS text** (§11 Q4):
> When v3+ reintroduces user-defined custom fields, do we ship them as
> `CUSTOM_FREETEXT` / `CUSTOM_FIXED` source types under the existing
> `label_preset_field.source_type` column, or as a separate
> `label_preset_custom_field` table? Affects the v2 schema shape we
> lock in here.

**Decision:** Single `source_type` column (v2 schema unchanged).
**Rationale:**
- The v2 `label_preset_field.source_type` column is already
  constrained to `'SYSTEM'`; the column exists to allow v3+ to
  introduce additional source types without an `ALTER TYPE` round trip.
- Single-table read path is simpler than join.
- Storage cost is negligible.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Separate `label_preset_custom_field` table. Rejected: forces a join
  on every read; doesn't add safety; doubles the schema surface.
- Remove `source_type` for v2 and add later. Rejected: future
  migration would need backfill; cheaper to keep the column now.

**Deferred to v3+:** Migration adds new values to the
`label_preset_field_source_type_check` constraint and a new
`field_value` JSONB column for custom-field payloads.

## 3. Deliberate divergences from the upstream FRS

Each divergence is documented for audit purposes. Divergences require
either (a) constitution compliance or (b) explicit stakeholder
acknowledgment (e.g., Jira comment).

### Divergence 1 — Editable post-save quantities (LOCKED YES)

**FRS markdown** (§4.6, §1.5): silent on editability. §1.5 lists
"Manual-confirm per-preset mode" as out-of-scope; §4.6 specifies
dynamic preset listing + per-preset Print buttons but does not
address editability.

**Jira description** (updated 2026-05-19 10:42 PT):
> "**Editable post-save quantities**: technicians can adjust counts in
> the post-save dialog before pressing Print."

**Locked engineering decision** (further tightened in `/speckit.clarify`
Q1, 2026-05-19): **Decrease-only**, audit-bound at saved qty.
- Carbon `<NumberInput min=0 max=order_label_request.qty>`.
- The Print action overwrites `order_label_request.qty` to the new
  (lower) value.
- To print MORE labels, re-open the order and re-save with a higher
  qty before printing (separable workflow).
- No separate `actual_printed_qty` audit column needed (saved qty IS
  the audit ceiling).

**Rationale:**
- Jira is the more recent source; tightens the FRS markdown.
- Closes the OGC-284 dialog gap (currently quantity is a static `<p>`).
- Audit-bound max prevents accidentally exceeding the saved quantity;
  decrease-only respects max-limit enforcement semantics.

**Follow-up:** Suggest the design author update FRS markdown §4.6 to match the
Jira description in a future FRS revision.

### Divergence 2 — OGC-284 Order Entry quantity UI gap is ABSORBED, not deferred

**FRS markdown** (§1.5 Out of Scope):
> "The OGC-284 Order Entry quantity UI gap. Tracked separately — see
> [OGC-284 cohesive FRS §10](./barcode-config.md)."

**Locked engineering decision:** ABSORBED into US4 (Migration &
continuity).

M5's LabelsSection rewrite replaces
[`frontend/src/components/barcodeWorkflow/LabelsSection.jsx`](/frontend/src/components/barcodeWorkflow/LabelsSection.jsx)
entirely. The current file (lines 30–42) hardcodes
`applicableLabelTypes: ["specimen"]`; the M5 rewrite makes the file
render two dynamic-column tables driven by linked presets. The
hardcode disappears as a side effect.

**Rationale:**
- Same code is rewritten anyway. Deferring the OGC-284 fix to a
  separate ticket means writing a temporary patch on a file the M5
  rewrite is about to replace. Throwaway code is worse than no code.
- One reviewable rewrite beats two patches.
- OGC-284 retro closure is faster (M5 merge, not a follow-up ticket).

The OGC-284 Gap Closure Matrix at
[../OGC-284-barcode-label-quantity-management/spec.md#gap-closure-matrix](../OGC-284-barcode-label-quantity-management/spec.md#gap-closure-matrix)
records this absorption row-by-row.

### Divergence 3 — Legacy BarcodeConfiguration page DELETED in M3

**FRS markdown** (§5):
> "**This release does NOT move, rebuild, or supersede that surface.**
> Label Presets is the new per-preset admin surface; the existing
> Barcode Configuration page continues to host site-wide barcode
> settings unchanged."

**Constitution constraint:** Principle X (Legacy Code Removal) — "no
dual-write, no legacy-first". Leaving a parallel
BarcodeConfiguration page (even one trimmed to just the Preprinted
Accession Number controls) violates this principle.

**Locked engineering decision** (`/speckit.clarify` Q2, 2026-05-19):
- M3 deletes
  [`frontend/src/components/admin/barcodeConfiguration/BarcodeConfiguration.jsx`](/frontend/src/components/admin/barcodeConfiguration/BarcodeConfiguration.jsx)
  entirely (1396 LOC).
- Backend `BarcodeConfigurationRestController.java` qty/dim/element
  endpoints are removed in the same PR.
- The Preprinted Accession Number controls
  (`prePrintDontUseAltAccession` toggle +
  `prePrintAltAccessionPrefix` input) move into the new Master Lists
  → Label Presets surface as a "Site-wide Barcode Settings" section
  above the preset list.
- `site_information.barcode.preprinted.*` keys keep their existing
  semantics; only the UI host moves.
- A redirect from `/MasterListsPage#barcodeConfiguration` →
  `/MasterListsPage#labelPresets` preserves bookmark continuity for
  one release cycle.

**Rationale:** Constitution Principle X mandates removal of the
legacy surface when superseded. The single consolidated admin page
matches the "single clear place for a single clear workflow"
principle the user articulated.

**Stakeholder communication:** Divergence announced via
[Jira comment #28885](https://uwdigi.atlassian.net/browse/OGC-285?focusedCommentId=28885)
on OGC-285 (2026-05-19). Design team can flag in that thread if they
have a reason to keep parallel pages; otherwise the lock takes
effect in the M3 PR.

### Divergence 4 — Legacy `BarcodeConfigurationRestController` DELETED in M3; new `SiteWideBarcodeSettingsRestController` hosts preprinted endpoints

**FRS markdown** (§5): silent on backend controller structure.

**Constitution constraint:** Principle X (Legacy Code Removal). Leaving a parallel `BarcodeConfigurationRestController` after the new `LabelPresetRestController` ships violates "no dual-write, no legacy-first".

**Locked engineering decision** (remediation pass 2026-05-19):

- M3 PR **deletes** `src/main/java/org/openelisglobal/barcode/controller/rest/BarcodeConfigurationRestController.java` entirely.
- A new `src/main/java/org/openelisglobal/labelpreset/controller/rest/SiteWideBarcodeSettingsRestController.java` hosts the `barcode.preprinted.use_order_entry_format` toggle + `barcode.preprinted.prefix` endpoints (the ONLY surviving site-wide barcode setting).
- `site_information.barcode.preprinted.*` keys keep their existing semantics; only the controller (and the UI host inside Master Lists → Label Presets) move.
- Scope: `admin.barcode.manage` on the new endpoints.

**Rationale:** preset CRUD ≠ site-wide settings — separate concerns deserve separate controllers. Mixing them in `LabelPresetRestController` would conflate the surfaces a future engineer reads.

### Divergence 5 — `BarcodeWorkflowPrintServiceImpl` DELETED in M5a

**FRS markdown** (§4): describes the v2 aggregation logic but does not explicitly call out the fate of the v1 service.

**Constitution constraint:** Principle X. After M5a introduces `OrderEntryLabelRequestService` as the authoritative aggregator, keeping `BarcodeWorkflowPrintServiceImpl.java` alive as a thin wrapper (or a parallel path) violates "no dual-write".

**Locked engineering decision** (remediation pass 2026-05-19):

- M5a PR **deletes** `src/main/java/org/openelisglobal/barcode/service/BarcodeWorkflowPrintServiceImpl.java` entirely along with its interface `BarcodeWorkflowPrintService.java` if present.
- Any remaining callers in the codebase are updated to call `OrderEntryLabelRequestService` directly.
- Grep gate: `grep -rE 'BarcodeWorkflowPrintService' src/main/java/ && exit 1 || exit 0` MUST pass in the M5a PR.

**Rationale:** v1's `applicableLabelTypes: ["specimen"]` hardcode lived at `BarcodeWorkflowPrintServiceImpl.java:43`. Deleting the file in M5a is the only way to guarantee that hardcode does not survive M5 in any form.

### Divergence 6 — Phase A legacy modernization bundled into M2

**FRS markdown:** silent on Hibernate mapping format of legacy entities.

**Constitution constraint:** Principle X — "Mandate to address legacy/deprecated code when touched". CLAUDE.md is explicit:
> "Valueholders MUST use JPA/Hibernate annotations (NO XML mapping files - legacy exempt until refactored)"

OGC-285 touches the `sample`, `sample_item`, and `test` tables via FK relationships from the new `order_label_request`, `test_label_config`, and `test_label_preset_link` tables. Their valueholders (`Sample.java`, `SampleItem.java`, `Test.java`) are currently XML-mapped via `.hbm.xml` files (`src/main/resources/hibernate/hbm/{Sample,SampleItem,Test}.hbm.xml`, 365 lines total). M2 is the natural opportunity to retire these XML mappings.

**Locked engineering decision** (remediation pass round 2, 2026-05-19):

M2 PR bundles **Phase A modernization**:

1. Re-annotate `src/main/java/org/openelisglobal/sample/valueholder/Sample.java` with JPA annotations (`@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Id` with the existing `StringSequenceGenerator` referenced via `@GenericGenerator`, `@Column` for each field, `@ManyToOne` for each relationship matching the existing `<many-to-one>` mappings, `@Version` already inherited from `BaseObject<String>`).
2. Same for `src/main/java/org/openelisglobal/sampleitem/valueholder/SampleItem.java`.
3. Same for `src/main/java/org/openelisglobal/test/valueholder/Test.java`.
4. Keep `String id` + `@Type(LIMSStringNumberUserType)` for the bridge — Phase A is annotation format only, NOT schema change.
5. Delete `src/main/resources/hibernate/hbm/Sample.hbm.xml`, `SampleItem.hbm.xml`, `Test.hbm.xml`.
6. Update `src/main/resources/hibernate/hibernate.cfg.xml` to remove the now-deleted `<mapping resource>` entries.

**Verification:**
- Grep gate: `find src/main/resources/hibernate/hbm -name "{Sample,SampleItem,Test}.hbm.xml" && exit 1 || exit 0`.
- Hibernate boot validates JPA mappings at startup; broken annotations fail loudly.
- Run full existing test suite (`mvn test`) — passes green.
- Spot-check a few critical queries against the modernized entities (e.g., `Sample` load + lazy-load a relationship).

**Rationale:** CLAUDE.md explicitly requires this when legacy is touched; OGC-285 is the touching event; the 3 .hbm.xml files are tractable (~15-20 fields/relationships each, all with modern JPA equivalents); 61 entities already use JPA annotations as templates.

**Phase B (deferred to follow-up ticket; not yet filed):** the `numeric(10,0)` → `INTEGER` schema modernization for `sample.id` / `sample_item.id` / `test.id` is a separate epic. Cost: ALTER COLUMN on 3 parents + 9 FK referencing columns + migrate hundreds of consumers from `String id` to `Integer id`. **Filed as a precursor for the next major schema simplification effort (Jira ticket TBD; create post-OGC-285 M2 merge).** This is the single canonical reference; other mentions in spec.md / plan.md point here.

## 4. Clarifications integrated from `/speckit.clarify` Session 2026-05-19

Three additional decisions locked in spec.md beyond the FRS Open
Questions:

### Clarification — Post-save quantity edit bounds

**Decision** (folded into Divergence 1 above): Decrease-only,
audit-bound at saved qty. See spec.md FR-022 + Clarifications
section.

### Clarification — Legacy BarcodeConfiguration page lifecycle after M3

**Decision** (folded into Divergence 3 above): Consolidate
(constitution Principle X).

### Clarification — Preset name uniqueness scope

**Decision:** Case-insensitive AND trim leading/trailing whitespace.
- Service layer normalizes via `name.trim().toLowerCase()` before
  uniqueness check.
- DDL `UNIQUE` constraint on `label_preset.name` serves as
  defense-in-depth (catches anything bypassing the service).
- "Cryo Vial", "cryo vial", "CRYO VIAL", "  Cryo Vial  " are all
  treated as the same name and collide on save.

**Rationale:** Prevents the most common admin error (typo/
capitalization creating silent duplicates in pickers); standard
pattern for human-facing admin names (test names, user logins, etc.).
FR-002 / AC-4 acceptance test must cover all three normalization
cases (case difference, leading whitespace, trailing whitespace).

**Alternatives considered:**
- Exact-match only (DDL UNIQUE). Rejected: high typo-duplicate risk.
- Case-insensitive only (no whitespace trim). Rejected: leading/
  trailing spaces are invisible to admin eyes.

## 5. Source-code-truth verifications (2026-05-19)

These are facts about the develop branch state at planning time. They
inform M2 / M4 scope and replace conditional language in spec.md
Assumptions & Constraints.

### Verification — OGC-761 `test_label_preset_link` table

**Method:** `grep -rE "test_label_preset_link|test_label_config|label_preset"
src/main/resources/liquibase/` returns no matches.
**Conclusion:** Table does NOT exist on develop. The FRS §3.5
assumption "introduced by OGC-761" is not yet realized.
**Impact:** M2 Liquibase changeset creates the full table from
scratch with all v2 columns including `allow_override`. The FRS §3.5
`ALTER` becomes a `CREATE`.

### Verification — OGC-746 Test Editor scaffold

**Method:** `find frontend/src/components/admin/testManagement -name "*.jsx"`
returns only `ManageMethod.jsx` and `ViewTestCatalog.jsx`. No
`TestEditor.jsx` or similar scaffold exists.
**Conclusion:** OGC-746 scaffold not yet on develop.
**Impact:** M4 frontend ships a temporary Carbon `<Tabs>` host in
`ViewTestCatalog.jsx` hosting the Labels tab; migrate to the
OGC-746 scaffold when it ships. M4 backend is unblocked.

### Verification — BarcodeConfiguration.jsx hosts Preprinted controls

**Method:** `grep -iE "prePrint|preprint" frontend/src/components/admin/barcodeConfiguration/BarcodeConfiguration.jsx`
returns `prePrintDontUseAltAccession`, `setPrePrintDontUseAltAccession`,
`prePrintAltAccessionPrefix`, `handleSitePrefixPrePrintedValue`.
**Conclusion:** The 1396-LOC `BarcodeConfiguration.jsx` does contain
the Preprinted Accession Number toggle + prefix controls (FRS §5 is
correct about that). M3 migration plan must extract these controls
into the new Label Presets surface BEFORE deleting the file.
**Impact:** M3 PR scope includes the controlled migration of the
Preprinted controls to the new surface, not just deletion.

### Verification — Locale files inventory

**Method:** `ls frontend/src/languages/`.
**Conclusion:** 20 locale JSON files exist (`am_ET`, `ar`, `bg`,
`de`, `en`, `en_GB`, `en_LK`, `en_US`, `es`, `fr`, `id`, `id_ID`,
`mg`, `ro`, `ru`, `si`, `si_LK`, `sw`, `ta`). Per durable memory
rule "Transifex manages translations", only `en.json` may be edited
in PRs; the other 19 are Transifex-managed.
**Impact:** All milestone PRs MUST edit ONLY `en.json` for new keys.
Reviewer enforces; no CI gate currently catches accidental edits.

### Verification (NEW, 2026-05-19) — Entity ID convention: `BaseObject<Integer>` for new entities

**Method:** Read `src/main/java/org/openelisglobal/barcode/valueholder/SampleBarcodeInfo.java` (the canonical OGC-284 new-pattern entity).
**Conclusion:** New JPA-annotated entities use `BaseObject<Integer>` + `Integer id` + `@SequenceGenerator(sequenceName = "{table}_seq", allocationSize = 1)` + `INTEGER` DB column. Legacy entities (e.g., `Sample`) use `String id` + `numeric(10,0)` + `LIMSStringNumberUserType` bridge. The `Sample.java` file at `src/main/java/org/openelisglobal/sample/valueholder/Sample.java` has NO `@Entity` or `@Id` annotation (legacy XML mapping pattern).
**Impact:** All 5 OGC-285 entities follow the SampleBarcodeInfo pattern: `BaseObject<Integer>` + `Integer id` with sequence-driven generation. No exceptions; no `BaseObject<String>` carve-outs. For FK references to legacy tables (`sample`, `sample_item`, `test`), declare a `@ManyToOne` (or `@OneToOne` for 1:1 associations) JPA relationship to the legacy entity — Hibernate routes through the legacy `LIMSStringNumberUserType` automatically at the relationship boundary. For 1:1 associations like `TestLabelConfig` ↔ `Test`, the entity has its own Integer surrogate PK with `@JoinColumn(name = "test_id", unique = true)` on the FK column (mirrors how `SampleBarcodeInfo` associates 1:1 with `Sample`). See [data-model.md §5](./data-model.md) for the full pattern.

### Verification (NEW, 2026-05-19) — Audit timestamp + optimistic locking inherited from `BaseObject`

**Method:** Read `src/main/java/org/openelisglobal/common/valueholder/BaseObject.java`.
**Conclusion:** `BaseObject<PK>` declares `@Column(name = "last_updated") @Version private Timestamp lastupdated;`. All entities extending it inherit:
- Optimistic-locking column `last_updated TIMESTAMP` (no TZ).
- Java type `java.sql.Timestamp` (NOT `OffsetDateTime`, NOT `LocalDateTime`).
- `@Version` on `lastupdated` for Hibernate's optimistic concurrency control.
**Impact:** OGC-285 entity declarations MUST NOT add their own `created_at` / `updated_at` columns or `@CreationTimestamp` / `@UpdateTimestamp` annotations. They inherit `lastupdated` from `BaseObject`. The Liquibase DDL DOES include `<column name="last_updated" type="TIMESTAMP"/>` on every new table (matches OGC-284 `028-barcode-info-tables.xml`).

### Verification (NEW, 2026-05-19) — Test infrastructure: `BaseWebContextSensitiveTest` + DBUnit

**Method:** Read `src/test/java/org/openelisglobal/BaseWebContextSensitiveTest.java`.
**Conclusion:**
- Extends `AbstractTransactionalJUnit4SpringContextTests` (JUnit 4, NOT JUnit 5).
- Uses DBUnit with `org.dbunit.ext.postgresql.PostgresqlDataTypeFactory` for fixture loading via `FlatXmlDataSet`.
- Class-default `@Transactional(propagation = Propagation.NOT_SUPPORTED)` (per-test rollback opt-in).
- `@ContextConfiguration(classes = { BaseTestConfig.class, AppTestConfig.class })` is the test-context pattern.
- `MockMvc` is built via `MockMvcBuilders.webAppContextSetup(...)`.
**Impact:** OGC-285 backend integration tests MUST extend `BaseWebContextSensitiveTest` (not invent their own test base). Test fixtures are `.xml` DBUnit format under `src/test/resources/fixtures/ogc-285/`, NOT `.sql` files or Hibernate builders. Reuse `BaseTestConfig` + `AppTestConfig` for `@ContextConfiguration`; do not introduce new test config classes.

### Verification (NEW, 2026-05-19) — JSONB binding: existing `JsonBinaryType` UserType

**Method:** `find src/main -name 'JsonBinaryType.java'`; grep usage.
**Conclusion:** `src/main/java/org/openelisglobal/hibernate/type/JsonBinaryType.java` exists and is used by `Alert` (`src/main/java/org/openelisglobal/alert/valueholder/Alert.java`) and `PatientMergeAudit`. Pattern:
```java
@Entity
@TypeDef(name = "jsonb", typeClass = JsonBinaryType.class)
public class Alert extends BaseObject<Integer> {
    @Type(type = "jsonb")
    @Column(name = "..." columnDefinition = "jsonb")
    private MyDto data;
}
```
**Impact:** OGC-285's `OrderLabelRequest.preset_snapshot` JSONB column uses the SAME `JsonBinaryType` pattern. We do NOT introduce Hibernate 6.x's native `@JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.JSON)` — that's a different binding mechanism not yet adopted in this codebase. Keep consistent with `Alert` + `PatientMergeAudit`.

### Verification (NEW, 2026-05-19) — `npm run pw:test` script + variants

**Method:** Read `frontend/package.json` scripts block.
**Conclusion:** `pw:test` exists as `"pw:test": "playwright test"`. 12 additional `pw:test:*` variants for project-specific test buckets (harness-demo, core-app, etc.).
**Impact:** OGC-285 Playwright tests run via `npm run pw:test -- {spec-file}` for one-offs, or `npm run pw:test:core-app` for the OE app project bucket. CLAUDE.md "never raw `npx playwright test`" rule applies — always go through npm scripts.

## 6. Workflow inventory (M5 scope)

The M5 LabelsSection rewrite must update every barcode-printing
sample-creation workflow in the codebase. Starting list, drawn from
OGC-284's quickstart workflow inventory + a 2026-05-19 audit:

| Workflow | Primary file | M5 update needed |
|---|---|---|
| Add Order (`/SamplePatientEntry`) | [`frontend/src/components/addOrder/AddOrder.jsx`](/frontend/src/components/addOrder/AddOrder.jsx) | YES — primary surface for the two-table v2 layout. |
| Add Order Success Message | [`frontend/src/components/addOrder/OrderSuccessMessage.jsx`](/frontend/src/components/addOrder/OrderSuccessMessage.jsx) | YES — pass `orderLabelRequests` to PostSavePrintDialog (M6). |
| Order View (reprint surface) | (TBD by audit during M5/M6 planning) | YES — wire reprint via snapshot endpoint. |
| Pathology workflow (if separate) | (Audit during M5 planning) | UNKNOWN — verify in M5 prep. |
| Generic Sample Order (FHIR endpoint) | [`src/main/java/org/openelisglobal/genericsample/`](/src/main/java/org/openelisglobal/genericsample/) | YES — backend orchestration accepts new label request payload shape. |

The M5 engineer audits the full list during T040..T043 planning and
updates this table with any newly discovered workflows. M5 cannot
ship until every barcode-printing workflow is on the v2 path.

## 7. Risks & unknowns

- **OGC-746 (Test Editor scaffold) landing date.** Verified absent
  2026-05-19. M4 frontend ships the `<Tabs>` shim in
  `ViewTestCatalog.jsx`; migration to OGC-746 scaffold becomes a
  follow-up task when OGC-746 lands. M4 backend is unblocked.
- **`site_information.barcode.*` data quality across deployed sites.**
  Malformed numeric values (non-integer, negative, missing) must
  apply the canonical fallback per OGC-284 FR-004 (default `1`, max
  `10`). M2 includes a data-integrity test against a sample of
  production-like configs.
- **Snapshot JSONB shape evolution.** Future fields added to
  `label_preset` will NOT retro-appear in historical snapshots. This
  is documented in spec.md (US5 acceptance scenarios) and in
  data-model.md §4.
- **Translation drift.** Non-English locale files are Transifex-
  managed; all milestone PR engineers MUST keep
  `frontend/src/languages/fr.json` and other locale files
  unmodified. CI does not currently catch accidental edits;
  reviewers verify in PR.
- **Performance under high test count.** Order Entry with 20+ tests
  could cause the aggregation function to fan out heavily. M5
  performance target: `POST /api/orderEntry/labelRequest` < 100ms p95
  with 20 tests. If not met, add server-side caching keyed by
  test_id_set.
