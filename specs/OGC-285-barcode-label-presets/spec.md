(v2.5 · 2026-05-19 17:45 UTC)

## Overview

Extend OpenELIS Global's barcode label system from a fixed set of five hardcoded
system label types (Order / Specimen / Block / Slide / Freezer) to an
**admin-configurable label preset system**. Lab administrators define their own
label types — including custom dimensions, barcode style, and content fields —
and tests in the Test Catalog declare which presets they require and at what
quantity. Order Entry aggregates label requirements across all tests in an order
and produces a single, deterministic label workload. Historical orders reprint
from a JSONB snapshot frozen at save time, so admin edits to a preset do not
retroactively change labels on saved orders.

This release also closes the OGC-284 acceptance criteria that did not ship in v1
(block/slide/freezer per-sample inputs, editable post-save quantities, Skip —
Print Later, max-limit override semantics). The unshipped FRs and their
absorption mapping are recorded in
[../OGC-284-barcode-label-quantity-management/spec.md § Gap Closure Matrix](../OGC-284-barcode-label-quantity-management/spec.md#gap-closure-matrix).

This specification is the engineering contract for OGC-285. The FRS (linked
above) is the authoritative design source; this spec transforms that prose
narrative into testable user stories, acceptance criteria, and functional
requirements. Prose stays in the FRS; requirements live here.

## Clarifications

### Session 2026-05-19 — FRS Open Questions resolved

The FRS v2.5 records four open questions in §11. Resolutions locked in this
spec, with rationale captured in [research.md](./research.md):

- **Q1 (snapshot vs current preset for reprint)** → **Snapshot only.** AC-20 is
  the canonical statement. Reprint reads the JSONB snapshot frozen at order save
  time. The "always-current" alternative is deferred to v3+ Future
  Considerations to avoid label drift from admin edits.
- **Q2 (allow-override toggle home)** → **Per-test only.** The existing
  combination of `test_label_preset_link.allow_override` (per-link) plus
  `test_label_config.allow_order_entry_override` (per-test master) is
  sufficient. No per-lab layer in v2.
- **Q3 (a11y drag-drop for content fields)** → **Keyboard Arrow Up/Down + native
  HTML5 drag for mouse.** No react-aria dependency.
- **Q4 (future custom-field shape)** → **Single `source_type` column on
  `label_preset_field`.** Schema unchanged for v2; v3+ migration decision
  deferred.

### Session 2026-05-19 — /speckit.clarify

- Q: Post-save quantity edit bounds — can the technician INCREASE beyond saved
  qty, or only DECREASE (audit-bound)? → A: **Decrease-only**, audit-bound at
  saved qty. `<NumberInput min=0 max=order_label_request.qty>`. The Print action
  overwrites `order_label_request.qty` to the new (lower) value. To print MORE
  labels, re-open the order and re-save with a higher qty before printing
  (separable workflow). Rationale: preserves audit trail (saved qty = ceiling);
  aligns with OGC-284 max-limit enforcement philosophy; avoids needing a
  separate `actual_printed_qty` column.
- Q: Legacy BarcodeConfiguration page lifecycle after M3 — keep parallel admin
  surfaces or consolidate? → A: **Consolidate.** M3 deletes
  `frontend/src/components/admin/barcodeConfiguration/BarcodeConfiguration.jsx`
  entirely along with its backend `BarcodeConfigurationRestController.java`
  qty/dim/element endpoints. The Preprinted Accession Number controls
  (`prePrintDontUseAltAccession` toggle + `prePrintAltAccessionPrefix` input,
  currently inside BarcodeConfiguration.jsx) move into the new Master Lists →
  Label Presets surface as a small "Site-wide Barcode Settings" section above
  the preset list. Single admin page for all barcode admin. Legacy
  `site_information.barcode.preprinted.*` keys retain their semantics (no
  rename); the M3 PR rewires the new section to the same keys. Rationale:
  enforced by constitution Principle X (Legacy Code Removal — "no dual-write, no
  legacy-first"); also satisfies "no parallel legacy admin surfaces" principle.
  This is a 3rd deliberate divergence from the upstream FRS — announced via Jira
  comment on [OGC-285](https://uwdigi.atlassian.net/browse/OGC-285).
- Q: Preset name uniqueness — exact-match, case-insensitive, or with whitespace
  trim? → A: **Case-insensitive AND trim leading/trailing whitespace.** Service
  layer normalizes via `name.trim().toLowerCase()` before uniqueness check; DDL
  UNIQUE constraint serves as defense-in-depth (catches anything bypassing the
  service). "Cryo Vial", "cryo vial", "CRYO VIAL", " Cryo Vial " are all treated
  as the same name and collide on save. FR-002 / AC-4 acceptance test must cover
  all three normalization cases (case, leading whitespace, trailing whitespace).
  Rationale: prevents the most common admin error (typo/capitalization creating
  silent duplicates in pickers); standard pattern for human-facing admin names.

### Session 2026-05-19 — Deliberate divergences from the upstream FRS

Two locks intentionally tighten or invert the FRS markdown:

- **Editable post-save quantities = YES** (per the 2026-05-19 Jira edit, which
  postdates the FRS markdown). The post-save dialog renders quantities as Carbon
  `<NumberInput>` with `min=0` and `max` from `order_label_request.qty` at save
  time. This closes the OGC-284 dialog gap that currently renders quantity as a
  `<p>` element. The FRS markdown §4.6 is silent on editability; the Jira
  description's "Locked design decisions (May 2026)" section is the tightening
  source.
- **OGC-284 Order Entry quantity UI gap is NOT deferred** (contra FRS §1.5 which
  lists it as out-of-scope). The gap is absorbed by US4 because the M5
  LabelsSection rewrite removes the `applicableLabelTypes: ["specimen"]`
  hardcode as a side effect. Deferring it would create throwaway code; M5 must
  rewrite that file anyway.

### Session 2026-06-01 — /speckit.clarify

Discovered while attempting the Principle X removal of the legacy
`BarcodeWorkflowPrintService` (T148): the non-test-driven per-sample label
problem decomposes into a bug (Specimen), a genuine design gap (Block / Slide /
Freezer), and a dependent deletion.

- Q: Where does the Block / Slide / Freezer **contextual** (non-test-driven)
  per-sample applicability model — the piece that unblocks pathology migration
  and full removal of the legacy `BarcodeWorkflowPrintService` — get built? → A:
  **M7, a new final OGC-285 milestone PR.** PR #3676 (M2–M6) ships now plus the
  Specimen universal-fallback bug fix (FR-014a). M7 adds the contextual
  applicability mechanism (Q2 below), migrates the pathology / cytology / IHC
  and generic-sample flows onto the preset/snapshot model, and deletes
  `BarcodeWorkflowPrintService` (Principle X / T148). Rationale: the legacy
  service is genuinely load-bearing for pathology (which injects Block / Slide /
  Freezer counts onto the order with no test→preset link), so removing it
  requires net-new applicability modeling that warrants its own reviewable
  milestone (Principle IX) rather than re-opening the already-complete #3676.
- Grounded findings behind the decision (verified in code): the aggregation
  (`OrderEntryLabelRequestServiceImpl`) sources per-sample columns ONLY from
  `test_label_preset_link`, and the seed defaults all four per-sample presets to
  `default_per_sample = 1`. So neither "emit only linked presets" (drops
  Specimen on orders whose tests link none — the regression) nor "emit all
  active system per-sample presets" (queues Block / Slide / Freezer = 1 on a
  plain blood draw) is correct. The model must distinguish **universal**
  per-sample presets (always emitted per sample; test links only override
  quantity) from **contextual** ones (emitted only where an applicability rule
  matches). Specimen vanishing is a bug against the merged FR-014 + Edge Cases,
  fixed in #3676 (FR-014a), not a design question.
- Q: When M7 attaches **contextual** (non-test-driven) per-sample presets, what
  is the applicability mechanism? → A: **A `sample_type → preset` association**
  — a new join table keyed `type_of_sample_id → preset_id`, carrying per-type
  `default_qty` / `max_qty`. Admins map which sample types carry which
  contextual presets; the aggregation includes, for each sample, the presets
  associated with that sample's `TypeOfSample`, with quantity editable at order
  entry and snapshot-frozen on save like every other cell. Rationale:
  generalizes the hardcoded pathology `getNumBlockLabels()` / Slide / Freezer
  form counts into configuration (configuration-driven, not code-driven) and
  reuses the existing `TypeOfSample` entity. Rejected: a per-preset sample-type
  list (no per-type quantity granularity) and per-flow wiring (keeps
  applicability code-driven).

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 — Configure Label Presets in Admin (Priority: P1)

A laboratory administrator opens **Administration → Master Lists → Label
Presets**, sees the five system presets pre-seeded from the legacy v1
configuration, creates a custom preset (e.g., "Cryo Vial Label" at 25 × 25 mm
with QR code, containing Lab Number + Storage Location + Expiry Date), assigns
dimensions and per-scope default/max quantities, and saves. The preset is then
available for linking from the Test Catalog Labels tab.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational surface — without admin CRUD on
presets, every downstream surface (Test Catalog linking, Order Entry
aggregation, post-save print) has no preset data to work with.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the Master Lists → Label
Presets page on a fresh installation, observing the 5 seeded system presets,
creating one custom preset, deactivating it, reactivating it, and confirming the
preset appears in subsequent lookups.

**Acceptance Scenarios** (FRS AC-1..AC-7):

1. **Given** an admin user lands on Master Lists → Label Presets on a fresh
   upgrade from v1, **When** the page loads, **Then** the user sees exactly five
   system presets (Order Label, Specimen Label, Block Label, Slide Label,
   Freezer Label) with `is_system = true`, named, dimensioned, and
   quantity-populated from the legacy `site_information.barcode.*` keys.
2. **Given** an admin user opens the "+ Add Label Preset" editor, **When** the
   user enters name "Cryo Vial Label", height 25 mm, width 25 mm, barcode type
   QR, content fields Lab Number + Storage Location + Expiry Date, scope
   per-sample with default 1 and max 4, and clicks Save, **Then** the preset
   persists and is returned by the next list request with the supplied values.
3. **Given** an admin user opens a system preset (e.g., Order Label), **When**
   the user attempts to deactivate it or rename it, **Then** the system blocks
   the save with an inline field-level error referencing `is_system = true`.
4. **Given** an admin user tries to save a preset with a name that matches an
   existing preset (case-insensitive), **When** they click Save, **Then** the
   system blocks the save with a field-level "name must be unique" error.
5. **Given** an admin user deactivates a custom preset that is currently linked
   to a test, **When** the deactivation completes, **Then** the preset
   disappears from the Test Catalog Labels tab "+ Add Label Type" picker, but
   historical orders that referenced it still print correctly via snapshot.
6. **Given** an admin user clicks "Save as new" (Duplicate), **When** they keep
   the original name and click Save, **Then** the system blocks save with a
   uniqueness error and requires entering a new name before saving.
7. **Given** an admin user enters `max_per_order = 3` and
   `default_per_order = 5` (or saves with both scope flags off), **When** they
   click Save, **Then** the system blocks save with a field-level validation
   error explaining the constraint.

---

### User Story 2 — Link presets to tests in Test Catalog (Priority: P1)

A laboratory administrator opens the **Test Catalog → Test Editor → Labels tab**
for a specific test (e.g., CBC with Differential), links one or more per-sample
label presets, sets per-test default and max quantities, and chooses whether
order-entry users can override the quantity. The Order Entry Preview card on the
page shows how the test's labels will surface during Order Entry.

**Why this priority**: Without test-level binding, Order Entry has no
test-driven default and falls back entirely on preset-level defaults — which
removes the whole purpose of per-test configuration. P1 because US3 depends on
this.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by linking two presets to one test,
saving, reloading the test editor, confirming the linked presets appear with the
saved quantities + allow-override flag, and observing the Order Entry Preview
render correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios** (FRS AC-8..AC-12):

1. **Given** a Test Editor for CBC, **When** the user opens the Labels SideNav
   entry, **Then** the Labels tab loads with a "Linked Label Presets" empty
   table and the "+ Add Label Type" button.
2. **Given** the Labels tab is open, **When** the admin links Specimen Label
   (default 1, max 5, allow override on) and Slide Label (default 4, max 12,
   allow override off) and clicks Save, **Then** both links persist and reload
   identically.
3. **Given** the Labels tab shows two linked presets, **When** the user views
   the Order Entry Preview, **Then** the preview accurately reflects the linked
   presets, their default quantities, and lock indicators for
   `allow_override = false`.
4. **Given** the user has Specimen Label already linked to CBC, **When** they
   open the "+ Add Label Type" picker, **Then** Specimen Label is excluded from
   the picker (preventing duplicate links).
5. **Given** the test-level `allow_order_entry_override` toggle above the table
   is off, **When** the page renders, **Then** all per-preset Allow Override
   checkboxes are forced off, disabled, and visually muted to indicate the
   test-level lockdown.

---

### User Story 3 — Aggregated, dynamic Order Entry Labels section (Priority: P1)

A laboratory technician creates an order with one or more tests (e.g., CBC +
Tissue Biopsy). The Order Entry **Labels section** (step 4) renders two Carbon
DataTables — Order Labels (per-order presets) and Sample Labels (per-sample
presets, one row per sample) — with dynamic columns built from the union of
presets linked to the order's tests. Each cell pre-populates from per-test or
preset defaults, shows a source tag explaining where the default came from,
locks if any linked test forbids override, and contributes to a live total row.

**Why this priority**: This is the user-facing payoff of the whole feature.
Without it, admins have configured presets that no order consumes.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting two tests with known
preset links, observing the columns + cells render per the aggregation rules,
adjusting an unlocked cell, observing the total update, saving the order, and
confirming `order_label_request` rows are persisted with the JSONB snapshot.

**Acceptance Scenarios** (FRS AC-13..AC-19):

1. **Given** a user adds CBC + Tissue Biopsy tests to an order, **When** they
   reach the Labels section, **Then** the Order Labels table shows all active
   per-order presets (system-first, then alphabetical) and the Sample Labels
   table shows the union of the universal per-sample presets
   (`is_universal = true`) and the per-sample presets linked to either test,
   system-first then alphabetical, with one row per sample.
2. **Given** the Sample Labels table is rendered, **When** the user inspects a
   cell, **Then** a small `<Tag>` chip below the `<NumberInput>` indicates the
   source — "from Test B" if a linked test drove the value, "system default" if
   no test in the order linked the preset.
3. **Given** the Slide Label preset is linked to Tissue Biopsy with
   `allow_override = false`, **When** the cell renders for the Tissue Biopsy
   sample row, **Then** the `<NumberInput>` is read-only with a lock icon and a
   tooltip "Quantity locked by test catalog".
4. **Given** two tests in the order link the same preset with different
   `allow_override` values (one true, one false), **When** the cell renders,
   **Then** the most-restrictive rule wins: cell is read-only with a lock icon,
   tooltip names the locking test.
5. **Given** Test A overrides Specimen Label default to 2 and Test B overrides
   it to 3, **When** the Specimen Label cell renders for a sample where both
   tests apply, **Then** the cell pre-populates with `3` (highest wins) and the
   source `<Tag>` reads "from Test B".
6. **Given** the user modifies an unlocked cell, **When** the value commits,
   **Then** the live Total row at the bottom recalculates immediately to reflect
   the new sum.
7. **Given** the user clicks "Save order & queue labels", **When** the order
   saves, **Then** the system writes one `order_label_request` row per
   `(sample, preset)` pair (and one for each Order-Labels cell) including a
   JSONB `preset_snapshot` matching the canonical shape in data-model.md §7.3.1
   of the FRS.

---

### User Story 4 — Migration & continuity (Priority: P1)

A site upgrading from OGC-284 (v1) to OGC-285 (v2) sees its existing barcode
configuration preserved: the 5 legacy system label types become 5 seeded
`is_system = true` Label Presets with dimensions and quantities copied from
`site_information.barcode.*` keys; legacy keys remain readable for one release
cycle; existing v1 orders continue to print correctly; and the M5 LabelsSection
rewrite closes the unshipped OGC-284 acceptance criteria as a side effect.

**Why this priority**: P1 because every deployed site is currently a v1
deployment. Migration must be transparent and reversible; otherwise the feature
cannot ship.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the migration against a
known v1 database snapshot, confirming the 5 system presets are created with
values matching the legacy keys, confirming legacy orders reprint correctly, and
confirming the LabelsSection.jsx applicableLabelTypes hardcode is removed.

**Acceptance Scenarios** (FRS AC-21..AC-24, plus OGC-284 gap closure):

1. **Given** a v1 deployment with populated `site_information.barcode.*` keys
   (order/specimen/block/slide/freezer × default/max/height/width), **When** the
   v2 Liquibase migration runs, **Then** exactly 5 `label_preset` rows are
   created with `is_system = true`, scope flags per FRS §2.7 (Order Label =
   per-order; the other 4 = per-sample), dimensions copied, and quantities
   mapped into the correct per-scope columns (Order Label → `default_per_order`
   / `max_per_order`; others → `default_per_sample` / `max_per_sample`).
2. **Given** a v1 deployment with legacy `site_information.barcode.*` keys,
   **When** the migration completes, **Then** the legacy keys remain readable in
   `site_information` (read-only mirror, one release cycle), and a follow-up
   migration in v2.x will remove them.
3. **Given** existing v1 orders in the database with rows in
   `sample_barcode_info` and `sample_item_barcode_info`, **When** a user opens
   an existing v1 order's View page, **Then** labels print correctly using the
   v1 schema fallback path until the v2 reprint path is fully wired (M6).
4. **Given** existing OGC-761 `test_label_preset_link` rows (if the table exists
   on develop at M2 start), **When** the v2 migration adds the `allow_override`
   column with default `true`, **Then** all existing rows persist and remain
   valid, with `allow_override` populated to its schema default.
5. **Given** the M5 LabelsSection rewrite lands, **When** a user creates a new
   order on Add Order, **Then** the Labels section renders the two-table v2
   layout instead of the v1 single-table specimen-only layout, closing OGC-284
   FR-005b and FR-010a as a side effect (see
   [Gap Closure Matrix](../OGC-284-barcode-label-quantity-management/spec.md#gap-closure-matrix)).

---

### User Story 5 — Reprint integrity via JSONB snapshot (Priority: P2)

A laboratory technician reprints labels for a previously saved order from the
Order View page. The labels render exactly as they did at original print time —
including content fields, dimensions, and barcode type — even if the admin has
subsequently edited the linked label preset. The snapshot JSONB stored at order
save time is the authoritative source for reprint rendering.

**Why this priority**: P2 because the main user-facing flow (US3) delivers value
without reprint-from-snapshot. But P2-not-P3 because without snapshot integrity,
admin preset edits cause label drift on historical orders — a chain-of-custody
risk.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by saving an order, mutating the
linked preset (e.g., add a content field, change dimensions), reprinting the
saved order, and confirming the labels render with the original snapshot
configuration, not the current preset.

**Acceptance Scenarios** (FRS AC-19..AC-20):

1. **Given** a user saves an order on 2026-06-01 with Specimen Label preset
   configured as `[Lab Number, Patient Name]`, **When** the save completes,
   **Then** the `order_label_request.preset_snapshot` JSONB column captures the
   preset config + per-test link settings + content field list at that moment.
2. **Given** an admin edits the Specimen Label preset on 2026-07-15 to add a
   Collection Date content field, **When** the technician reprints the
   2026-06-01 order, **Then** the reprinted labels use the snapshot (no
   Collection Date), not the current preset.
3. **Given** the preset's dimensions are modified post-save (e.g., 25 × 76 → 25
   × 50), **When** the order is reprinted, **Then** the PDF is sized to the
   snapshot's 25 × 76 dimensions.

---

### Edge Cases

- A v1 deployment has a malformed `site_information.barcode.X.default` value
  (non-numeric). Migration applies the canonical fallback (`1`) per OGC-284
  FR-004 and logs a warning, but does not fail.
- A test catalog row has no `test_label_preset_link` rows. Order Entry's Sample
  Labels table still shows the **universal** per-sample presets
  (`is_universal = true` — Specimen Label at v2) with "system default" source
  tags. **Contextual** per-sample presets (Block / Slide / Freezer) do NOT
  appear without a matching applicability rule (FR-014b, M7) — emitting them on
  every order would queue pathology/storage labels for unrelated samples (all
  four seed to `default_per_sample = 1`).
- A user adds two tests where the same preset is linked to both with conflicting
  allow-override settings. Most-restrictive wins (cell locked), tooltip names
  the locking test.
- A preset is deactivated mid-order-entry session (admin deactivates while
  another user has an order in progress). The in-progress order's Labels section
  continues to show the preset for that session; refresh pulls the deactivated
  preset out.
- A user submits a label save request that exceeds a per-preset max quantity for
  a cell where `allow_override = true`. Server-side validation rejects the save
  with a 422; client renders the field-level error.
- An order has zero tests selected. Order Labels table still renders (showing
  all active per-order presets); Sample Labels shows the universal per-sample
  presets (`is_universal = true` — Specimen Label at v2).
- A snapshot JSONB references a preset id that has been hard-deleted. Reprint
  uses the snapshot content; the missing preset is not re-fetched.
- A preset has both `prints_per_order = true` and `prints_per_sample = true`.
  The preset appears as a column in BOTH Order Labels and Sample Labels tables,
  with independent default quantities per scope.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

Renumbered from FRS LP-x, TL-x, OE-x, MG-x with original IDs preserved in
parentheses for traceability.

#### Label Presets — Master Lists Admin

- **FR-001 (LP-1)**: System MUST display a Label Presets list view at
  `/MasterListsPage#labelPresets`.
- **FR-002 (LP-2)**: Admins MUST be able to create a new preset with a unique
  name, integer-mm dimensions (height + width, 5..200), barcode type (Code 128 /
  QR / DataMatrix), and a selection of system content fields from the 15
  selectable system content fields enumerated in
  [data-model.md](./data-model.md) (plus the required `LAB_NUMBER` field locked
  at position 1, which every preset carries automatically — 16 `FieldKey` enum
  values total).
- **FR-003 (LP-3)**: Admins MUST be able to select content fields from the
  system field set and arrange them in display order. Lab Number is always
  required, always present, and locked at position 1.
- **FR-004 (LP-4)**: Admins MUST be able to duplicate a preset via "Save as
  new", clearing the name field for required entry.
- **FR-005 (LP-5)**: Admins MUST be able to deactivate a preset. Deactivated
  presets persist on historical orders but disappear from "+ Add Label Type"
  pickers.
- **FR-006 (LP-6)**: System MUST prevent renaming or deactivating any
  `is_system = true` preset.
- **FR-007 (LP-7)**: System MUST validate that
  `max_per_order ≥ default_per_order`, `max_per_sample ≥ default_per_sample`,
  all values are non-negative integers, and at least one scope
  (`prints_per_order` or `prints_per_sample`) is true.
- **FR-008 (LP-8)**: System MUST persist Lab Number as a required, locked,
  first-position field on every preset.

#### Test Catalog — Labels Tab

- **FR-009 (TL-1)**: System MUST display a Labels section in the Test Editor
  SideNav.
- **FR-010 (TL-2)**: Admins MUST be able to link any active per-sample preset to
  a test with default qty, max qty, and `allow_override` flag. The Preset
  dropdown MUST exclude presets where `prints_per_sample = false`.
- **FR-011 (TL-3)**: System MUST prevent linking the same preset to the same
  test twice.
- **FR-012 (TL-4)**: System MUST display an Order Entry Preview (Carbon
  `<StructuredList>`) summarizing the configuration.
- **FR-013 (TL-5)**: System MUST aggregate per-sample label requirements across
  all tests in an order by taking the highest
  `test_label_preset_link.default_qty` per preset.
- **FR-014 (TL-6)**: For a per-sample preset that is already a column in the
  Sample Labels table (universal, or linked by some test in the order), the
  System MUST fall back to `label_preset.default_per_sample` for any sample
  whose tests do not link that preset.
- **FR-014a (TL-6a)**: The Sample Labels table MUST always include the
  **universal** per-sample presets (`label_preset.is_universal = true`; Specimen
  Label at v2) as a column for every sample, independent of any test→preset
  link; test links only OVERRIDE the quantity for those columns. Non-universal
  per-sample presets appear only when a test in the order links them. (Closes
  the regression where an order whose tests link no per-sample preset produced
  zero Specimen labels. Shipped in #3676.)
- **FR-014b (TL-6b)**: The System MUST support **contextual** (non-test-driven)
  per-sample preset applicability so Block / Slide / Freezer labels attach to
  the samples that need them (pathology / storage workflows) without a
  test→preset link. Mechanism: a `sample_type → preset` association (a new join
  table keyed `type_of_sample_id → preset_id` with per-type `default_qty` /
  `max_qty`); the aggregation includes, for each sample, the presets associated
  with that sample's `TypeOfSample`, quantity editable at order entry and
  snapshot-frozen on save. Delivered in **M7**, the final OGC-285 milestone,
  which also migrates the pathology / cytology / IHC and generic-sample flows
  off the legacy `BarcodeWorkflowPrintService` and deletes it (Principle X /
  T148).

#### Order Entry

- **FR-015 (OE-1)**: System MUST dynamically construct Labels-section columns
  from the union of presets across all tests in the order, rendered as two
  tables (Order Labels for per-order presets, Sample Labels for per-sample
  presets).
- **FR-016 (OE-2)**: System MUST display, per cell, a source `<Tag>` indicating
  whether the value came from a test ("from Test X") or system default.
- **FR-017 (OE-3)**: Cells whose driving test has `allow_override = false` MUST
  be read-only with a lock icon. When multiple tests link the same preset and
  any one has `allow_override = false`, the cell MUST be locked
  (most-restrictive wins). Tooltip names the locking test.
- **FR-018 (OE-4)**: System MUST display a live Total row summing each column.
- **FR-019 (OE-5)**: System MUST persist the entered label quantities with the
  order upon Save, including a JSONB `preset_snapshot` per data-model.md.
- **FR-020 (OE-6)**: Reprinting from Order View MUST use the snapshot stored
  with the order, not the current `label_preset` config.

#### Post-Save Print Dialog

- **FR-021**: After successful order save and accession-number assignment,
  system MUST show a post-save print dialog listing every preset with a non-zero
  count in the saved order, dynamic across all active presets (not the v1
  5-fixed enum).
- **FR-022**: Each preset row in the dialog MUST provide a Carbon
  `<NumberInput>` showing the editable quantity (locked to v2 design per the
  2026-05-19 Jira tightening). `min = 0`, `max = order_label_request.qty` at
  save time.
- **FR-023**: Each preset row in the dialog MUST provide a Print button that
  opens a PDF in a new browser tab, generated from the preset's snapshot.
- **FR-024**: The dialog MUST provide a "Skip — Print Later" button that closes
  the dialog without printing and preserves reprint capability from the Order
  View page.
- **FR-025**: PDF labels MUST be sized to the snapshot dimensions, not the
  current preset dimensions.

#### Migration & Backward Compatibility

- **FR-026 (MG-1)**: At v2 release, system MUST create exactly one
  `label_preset` row per existing v1 system label type, populated from
  `site_information.barcode.*` keys per FRS §2.7.
- **FR-027 (MG-2)**: System MUST set `is_system = true` on each migrated preset.
- **FR-028 (MG-3)**: Existing OGC-761 `test_label_preset_link` rows MUST
  continue to function unchanged after the v2 schema additions; new
  `allow_override` column populates to `true` by default.
- **FR-029 (MG-4)**: Existing v1 orders MUST continue to print labels against
  their existing v1 schema until snapshot rewrite of historical orders is
  complete (not required for v2; v1 orders retain v1 behavior).
- **FR-030 (MG-5)**: Legacy `site_information.barcode.*` keys MUST be retained
  as read-only mirrors for one release cycle and removed in the subsequent
  maintenance migration.

#### Accessibility

- **FR-031 (AC-25)**: All Carbon components used MUST pass a screen-reader smoke
  test with NVDA (Windows) and/or VoiceOver (macOS). JAWS coverage is optional —
  NVDA is the open-source equivalent that exercises the same screen-reader
  contract. Aligns with tasks.md T086b/T200 and quickstart.md.
- **FR-032 (AC-26)**: Content-field reordering MUST work via keyboard (Arrow Up
  / Arrow Down on focused row).
- **FR-033 (AC-27)**: Color MUST NEVER be the sole indicator of status; system
  Tag, lock icon, and text labels MUST accompany color cues.

### Constitution Compliance Requirements (OpenELIS Global)

Derived from `.specify/memory/constitution.md`:

- **CR-001** (Principle II): UI components MUST use Carbon Design System
  (`@carbon/react`) exclusively. NO Bootstrap, NO Tailwind, NO custom CSS
  frameworks. Modal, DataTable, NumberInput, Dropdown, FilterableMultiSelect,
  Tag, StructuredList, Tabs, Checkbox, Toggle are the primary components used.
- **CR-002** (Principle VII): All user-facing strings MUST be internationalized
  via React Intl. NO hardcoded text. New keys land in
  `frontend/src/languages/en.json` ONLY; non-English locale files are
  Transifex-managed. Key prefixes:
  - `admin.labelPresets.*` for Master Lists → Label Presets
  - `admin.testCatalog.labels.*` for Test Catalog Labels tab
  - `orderEntry.labels.*` for Order Entry Labels section
  - `barcode.print.dialog.*` for the post-save print dialog
- **CR-003** (Principle IV): Backend MUST follow the 5-layer pattern:
  Valueholder → DAO → Service → Controller → Form. Services own
  `@Transactional`; controllers MUST NOT have `@Transactional`. Valueholders use
  JPA/Hibernate annotations (Jakarta EE 9 `jakarta.*`, NOT `javax.*`). New
  package: `org.openelisglobal.labelpreset.*`.
- **CR-004** (Principle VI): All schema changes MUST use Liquibase changesets.
  NO direct DDL/DML in production. New tables land in
  `src/main/resources/liquibase/3.3.x.x/0NN-label-preset-tables.xml` (NN = next
  available); migration data is in
  `src/main/resources/liquibase/3.3.x.x/0NN-seed-system-presets.xml`.
- **CR-005** (Principle III): Label Preset entities are NOT externally exposed
  (no FHIR R4 representation). The exception is the order label rendering on
  physical labels, which uses internal data only. No `fhir_uuid` required.
- **CR-006** (Principle I): Country-specific behavior MUST be
  configuration-driven (label preset content). No code branching on
  country/site.
- **CR-007** (Principle VIII): Security — admin endpoints require the
  `admin.barcode.manage` scope; test catalog endpoints require
  `admin.testCatalog.manage`; order entry endpoints require `order.create`;
  reprint endpoints require `order.read`. All input values validated server-side
  (dimensions, quantities, name uniqueness, scope constraint).
- **CR-008** (Principle V): Tests MUST precede implementation (TDD
  Red-Green-Refactor). JUnit 4 for backend (NOT JUnit 5); Vitest + React Testing
  Library for frontend; Playwright for E2E. Coverage target ≥ 70% for new
  modules.

### Key Entities

- **LabelPreset**: A reusable label template defining dimensions, barcode type,
  content fields, and per-scope default/max quantities. System presets
  (`is_system = true`) cannot be renamed or deactivated; custom presets are
  fully mutable.
- **LabelPresetField**: A row on a label preset selecting one of 15 system
  content fields with a position and required flag. Lab Number is locked at
  position 1.
- **TestLabelPresetLink**: An association between a Test and a LabelPreset
  (per-sample only) with per-test override of default qty, max qty, and
  `allow_override` flag. Reused from OGC-761; this release adds the
  `allow_override` column.
- **TestLabelConfig**: A per-test master toggle (`allow_order_entry_override`)
  that overrides all per-link `allow_override` flags when off.
- **SampleTypeLabelPreset** _(M7)_: A `sample_type → preset` association
  (`type_of_sample_id → preset_id`) with per-type `default_qty` / `max_qty`,
  giving **contextual** per-sample presets (Block / Slide / Freezer)
  applicability without a test→preset link (FR-014b). Distinct from
  `is_universal` presets (always-on, no association needed) and
  `TestLabelPresetLink` (test-driven).
- **OrderLabelRequest**: A per-`(parent_sample, sample_item, preset)` row
  capturing the entered quantity + a JSONB snapshot of the preset config at save
  time. The authoritative source for reprint rendering. Naming note: OpenELIS
  has no separate "order" table — the order identity is rooted in the parent
  `sample` row. Per-order labels have `sample_item_id IS NULL`; per-sample-item
  labels reference both the parent sample and the specific sample item.

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of fresh v2 installations show exactly 5 seeded system
  presets matching the FRS §2.7 mapping after migration.
- **SC-002**: 100% of upgraded v1 sites preserve their
  `site_information.barcode.*` configured values in the migrated system preset
  rows.
- **SC-003**: Admins can create a custom label preset (Cryo Vial example from
  FRS AC-2) in under 90 seconds from opening the editor to seeing the row appear
  in the list view.
- **SC-004**: 100% of Order Entry sessions on saved orders persist one
  `order_label_request` row per non-zero cell with a JSONB snapshot conforming
  to the FRS §7.3.1 shape.
- **SC-005**: 100% of reprints from Order View use the snapshot, not the current
  preset config (verifiable by post-save preset edit + reprint smoke test).
- **SC-006**: 100% of test catalog → labels-tab → order-entry round trips
  reflect the same default/max/lock state without manual intervention.
- **SC-007**: 100% of attempts to deactivate a system preset are blocked with a
  field-level error.
- **SC-008**: 100% of attempts to save a duplicate preset name (case-
  insensitive) are blocked with a field-level error.
- **SC-009**: All 27 FRS acceptance criteria (AC-1..AC-27) have at least one
  passing automated test before the corresponding milestone PR merges.
- **SC-010**: 0 hardcoded English strings introduced in new code; 100% of new
  user-facing strings reference an i18n key.
- **SC-011**: 0 instances of `applicableLabelTypes: ["specimen"]` remain in
  `frontend/src/components/barcodeWorkflow/` after M5 merges.

## Assumptions & Constraints

- **OGC-285 supersedes OGC-284 in scope.** The OGC-284 in-repo SpecKit is closed
  and superseded; unshipped OGC-284 FRs are absorbed by US4 per the
  [Gap Closure Matrix](../OGC-284-barcode-label-quantity-management/spec.md#gap-closure-matrix).
- **Editable post-save quantities = YES.** The Jira description's "Locked design
  decisions (May 2026)" supersedes the FRS markdown silence on this point; the
  post-save dialog renders quantities as Carbon `<NumberInput>` (audit-bound,
  `min = 0`, `max = order_label_request.qty` at save).
- **Snapshot is frozen.** Reprint always renders from snapshot. Future support
  for "use current preset on reprint" is deferred to v3+ Future Considerations.
- **OGC-746 (Test Editor scaffold) is NOT on develop** (verified by
  source-code-truth check 2026-05-19: only `ManageMethod.jsx` and
  `ViewTestCatalog.jsx` exist under
  `frontend/src/components/admin/testManagement/`). M4 frontend ships a
  temporary `<Tabs>` host in
  [ViewTestCatalog.jsx](../../frontend/src/components/admin/testManagement/ViewTestCatalog.jsx);
  migrate to the OGC-746 scaffold once it lands. M4 backend is unblocked.
- **OGC-761 `test_label_preset_link` table is NOT on develop** (verified by
  source-code-truth check 2026-05-19: no Liquibase changeset references the
  table). The M2 Liquibase changeset creates the full table from scratch with
  all v2 columns including `allow_override`; the FRS §3.5 ALTER reduces to a
  CREATE.
- **Legacy Barcode Configuration page is deleted in M3** (3rd deliberate
  divergence from FRS §5). The
  `frontend/src/components/admin/barcodeConfiguration/BarcodeConfiguration.jsx`
  file and its backend `BarcodeConfigurationRestController.java` qty/dim/element
  endpoints are removed in the same PR that ships the new Master Lists → Label
  Presets surface. The Preprinted Accession Number controls move into the new
  Label Presets page as a small "Site-wide Barcode Settings" section above the
  preset list, backed by the same `site_information.barcode.preprinted.*` keys
  (no rename, no semantics change). A redirect from the legacy
  `/MasterListsPage#barcodeConfiguration` URL to the new
  `/MasterListsPage#labelPresets` URL preserves bookmark continuity for one
  release cycle. Rationale: "no half-refactors" + "no parallel legacy admin
  surfaces" — single clear place for the single clear barcode-admin workflow.
  This divergence is documented in research.md (when authored by /speckit.plan)
  and announced via a comment on Jira
  [OGC-285](https://uwdigi.atlassian.net/browse/OGC-285).
- **Five hardcoded label types disappear from new code.** They survive as 5
  seeded `is_system = true` rows in `label_preset`. The frontend Barcode
  Configuration page may keep its current shape for one release cycle (defining
  seeded preset values via Master Lists → Label Presets is the v2 path).
- **Existing v1 orders use v1 print path.** The migration does not retroactively
  write `order_label_request` rows for historical orders. New orders (created
  after M5 lands) use the v2 path exclusively. Old orders reprint via the v1
  `sample_barcode_info` fallback until phased out.
- **i18n key budget.** New keys land in `en.json` only; French and other locales
  are Transifex-managed. Layout budget per surface accommodates ~30% text
  expansion.
- **PR discipline applies to every milestone PR.** No self-merge without
  non-Copilot human review; AC checklist in PR body; no mid-stream rescoping; no
  Jira self-resolve; ≤30 files / ≤2,500 LOC net per milestone PR; tests precede
  implementation; open PR as draft early.

## Out of Scope

Mirroring FRS §1.5, minus the OGC-284 deferral (absorbed by US4):

- **User-defined custom content fields** (free text or fixed-value rows on a
  preset). v2 supports only the 15-field system set; the
  `label_preset_field.source_type` column reserves the seat for v3+ expansion
  (CR-006: configuration-driven, not code-driven).
- **Live preview pane** in the preset editor. v2 has no in-editor rendering of
  the label; admins validate visually at print time.
- **Manual-confirm per-preset mode.** All presets auto-generate; the post-save
  print dialog's per-preset Print buttons are sufficient control.
- **Full WYSIWYG canvas designer.** v2 supports content-field selection +
  ordering, not pixel-perfect placement.
- **Per-preset font/typography controls.** Fields render in the system label
  font.
- **Conditional content fields** (e.g., "show Stain Type only when test is
  histology"). Deferred to v3+.
- **Multi-language labels.** Labels render in the system locale at print time.
- **Reprint audit trail beyond the snapshot itself.** Snapshot records what was
  printed; surfacing the reprint history in Order View is deferred to v3+.
