# Specification Quality Checklist: Barcode Labels v2 — Configurable Label Preset Management (OGC-285)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning (`/speckit.plan`).
**Created**: 2026-05-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) — _exception:
      Constitution Compliance Requirements (CR-001..CR-008) intentionally
      name Carbon, Hibernate, Liquibase, React Intl, etc., per the OpenELIS
      SpecKit override (constitution Principle IX). FRs themselves stay
      framework-neutral._
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs — user stories US1..US5
      describe admin/technician journeys; FRs derive testable behavior.
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders — Overview, User Stories,
      Acceptance Scenarios all read in plain language; technical detail is
      contained in Constitution Compliance + Key Entities sections.
- [x] All mandatory sections completed — Overview, Clarifications, User
      Scenarios & Testing, Requirements (FRs + Constitution Compliance +
      Key Entities), Success Criteria, Assumptions & Constraints, Out of
      Scope, References.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers remain — all four FRS Open
      Questions (Q1–Q4) resolved in spec.md Clarifications with full
      rationale; the two FRS divergences (editable post-save quantities;
      OGC-284 gap absorption) are explicit in Assumptions & Constraints.
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous — every FR-001..FR-033
      maps to either an acceptance scenario in spec.md or a direct
      validation step in success criteria.
- [x] Success criteria are measurable — SC-001..SC-011 each include
      a verifiable metric (counts, percentages, durations, presence/
      absence of specific code patterns).
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic — SC-001..SC-011 describe
      outcomes (e.g., "5 seeded system presets after migration", "0
      hardcoded English strings introduced"), not implementation choices.
      SC-011 references a specific code pattern but as an outcome (removal),
      not a technology requirement.
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined — US1..US5 each include 1–7
      acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format, fully covering the
      27 FRS ACs (AC-1..AC-27).
- [x] Edge cases are identified — Edge Cases section enumerates 8
      concrete edge cases (malformed config values, missing test links,
      conflicting allow_override, mid-session deactivation, over-max
      requests, zero-test orders, missing snapshot references, dual-scope
      presets).
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded — Out of Scope section lists 7 explicit
      non-goals (custom content fields, live preview, manual-confirm
      mode, WYSIWYG canvas, font/typography, conditional fields,
      multi-language labels, reprint audit beyond snapshot).
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified — Assumptions & Constraints
      section enumerates OGC-746, OGC-761, legacy site-wide settings,
      v1 order behavior, i18n key budget, engineering guardrails.

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria — FR-001..
      FR-033 each cite the originating FRS ID (LP-x / TL-x / OE-x / MG-x /
      AC-x) and traceable acceptance scenarios in the User Stories.
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows — US1 (admin CRUD), US2 (test
      catalog linking), US3 (order entry aggregation), US4 (migration +
      OGC-284 gap closure), US5 (reprint integrity) span every primary
      user journey in the FRS.
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria —
      SC-001..SC-011 collectively measure: migration correctness (SC-001,
      SC-002), admin UX speed (SC-003), persistence integrity (SC-004),
      reprint snapshot fidelity (SC-005), end-to-end test catalog
      round-trip (SC-006), validation enforcement (SC-007, SC-008), AC
      coverage (SC-009), i18n compliance (SC-010), OGC-284 gap closure
      (SC-011).
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification — except where
      the OpenELIS SpecKit override explicitly requires them (Carbon,
      Hibernate, Liquibase, React Intl, JUnit 4, Jakarta EE 9, Spring
      6.2.2) in the Constitution Compliance section. These are
      project-wide non-negotiables, not feature-specific choices.

## Validation Result

**Status**: ✅ All checklist items pass.

**Notes**:

- The OpenELIS SpecKit override (constitution Principle IX + the
  `/speckit.specify` "OpenELIS-Specific Requirements" section) requires
  the spec to embed framework constraints as Constitution Compliance
  Requirements (CR-001..CR-008). This intentionally deviates from the
  vanilla SpecKit "no implementation details" rule. The spec follows
  this override correctly.
- Two deliberate divergences from the upstream FRS v2.5 are documented in
  spec.md Assumptions & Constraints (editable post-save quantities;
  OGC-284 gap absorption). Rationale will be expanded in research.md
  when `/speckit.plan` runs.
- Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan` (which authors plan.md,
  data-model.md, contracts/, research.md, quickstart.md) and
  `/speckit.tasks` (which authors tasks.md).

## Notes

- Check items off as completed: `[x]`
- Add comments or findings inline
- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or
  `/speckit.plan`
