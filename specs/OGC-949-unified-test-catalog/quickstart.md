# Quickstart: Unified Test Catalog Management Editor (OGC-949)

Developer onboarding + per-milestone Independent-Test walkthroughs. Only M0 and
M1 are detailed now; a subsection is appended for each milestone at its ELABORATE
gate (the tasks.md gate task links `quickstart.md#m{N}` as the Independent Test).

## Orientation

- **Spec** ([spec.md](./spec.md)) integrates Jira + FRS + mockups. **Plan**
  ([plan.md](./plan.md)) is the canonical roadmap (milestone tables + graph).
  **Detailed acceptance criteria live in Jira** child stories (linked from the
  Source Map); **prose lives in the FRS** (pinned at openelis-work `@f04cce54`).
- **Branch lane**: every milestone PR targets `develop` as
  **the single feature branch `feat/ogc-949-m0-methods-port`** (PR #3709 →
  develop; maintainer direction 2026-06-11 — one branch carries spec + all
  milestones; the per-milestone branch scheme is superseded). Never target
  `demo-silnas`.
- **Before any milestone**: `git fetch origin`; rebase/merge latest `develop`
  into the feature branch if diverged; keep PR #3709's body updated with the
  milestone's AC checklist.
- **Formatting before every commit**: `mvn spotless:apply` (backend) and
  `cd frontend && npm run format` (frontend). Clear the spotless cache if CI
  flags a file local says is clean: `rm -rf target/spotless-* && mvn spotless:apply`.
- **Tests**: backend JUnit 4 + `BaseWebContextSensitiveTest`; frontend Jest +
  RTL; E2E **Playwright** via `npm run pw:test` (never raw `npx playwright`, no
  new Cypress).

## M0 — Reconciliation ✅ DONE (2026-06-11)

Completed on the feature branch: Methods port (commit `a35a6f7b2`; backend +
`MethodsSection.jsx` + 27 i18n keys; `TestModifyEntry.jsx` mount deliberately
NOT ported — entangled with demo-silnas compliance Tabs, deferred to M6 —
research.md §R1), decision records R1–R5, plus two incidental test-hardening
fixes (storage `ensureAuditSystemUser` guards; Cypress userManagement re-render
race). Steps below kept for the record.

1. **Port Methods (#3706) to develop.**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git checkout -b feat/ogc-949-m0-methods-port origin/develop
   # cherry-pick the OGC-750 Methods commit from demo-silnas (single squashed commit c9b623391)
   git cherry-pick c9b623391    # resolve conflicts: keep test_method table, 039 changeset, TestMethod*, MethodsSection.jsx
   ```
   - Verify the Liquibase changeset `039-test-method-links.xml` applies on a clean
     develop DB; run the Methods service/controller tests; smoke the
     `GET /rest/api/tests/{testId}/methods` endpoint.
   - **Independent Test**: Methods code green on develop (its existing tests pass);
     the editor Methods section (M6) later mounts this unchanged.
2. **Record the OGC-285 ↔ OGC-761 boundary** (already resolved — see
   research.md R2). No code; a decision note + a comment on
   [OGC-761](https://uwdigi.atlassian.net/browse/OGC-761) that it consumes
   OGC-285's `test_label_preset_link`.
3. **Sequence PR #3546 vs OGC-927** (research.md R4): confirm whether the admin
   SideNav consolidation lands before M2; if so, M2 builds on it; else M2 is
   sequenced after. Decision note only.
4. **Confirm the permission gate** (research.md R3): v1 uses
   `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")` + UI menu hide; **no** dependency on
   OGC-384 / #3443. Decision note only.

## M1 — Schema migrations + backend foundation (OGC-747)

Goal: land every v1 schema object (see [data-model.md](./data-model.md)) with a
**lossless** migration. This blocks all section work, so it ships first and is
the most carefully tested milestone.

**Status**: OGC-936 (changeset `040` + Test `domain` mapping; AMR reuses
existing `antimicrobialResistance` per R11) and OGC-937 (changeset `041` result
components + lossless backfill + `ComponentBackfillMigrationTest`) **shipped** —
commits `3ed42f06a`, `c0ae55170`, verified cold. Remaining: OGC-938 (042),
OGC-939 (043).

1. Continue on the single feature branch (no new branch — see Orientation).
2. Author Liquibase changesets `041`–`043` under
   `src/main/resources/liquibase/3.5.x.x/`, in the OGC-937→939 order
   (data-model.md § "Migration sequencing"). Wire each into the changelog include.
3. Add/extend valueholders (JPA/Hibernate annotations) for
   `test_result_component`, `test_result_interpretation`,
   `test_sample_handling`, `test_activation_acknowledgment`,
   `test_terminology_mapping`; ALTER the existing
   `org.openelisglobal.unitofmeasure.UnitOfMeasure` (never duplicate); real
   table names per data-model.md translation table (R9).
4. **Write the losslessness test first** (TDD red): seed a baseline catalog (use
   `src/test/resources/load-test-fixtures.sh`), run the migration, assert
   pre/post row counts match for `TEST`, `RESULT_LIMITS`, `TEST_RESULT`
   (real tables — FRS aliases `test_range`/`test_select_list_option`), and that
   every row carries a non-null `component_id` pointing at its test's PRIMARY
   component.
5. ORM validation tests for the new entities (must run <5s, no DB).
6. **Dry-run** the migration against a production-like dump before opening for
   review.

   **Independent Test (M1)**: on a populated DB, `liquibase update` then
   `rollback` run clean; the losslessness test is green; a freshly created test via
   the new backend service requires `domain` and resolves units to the master
   list. See spec US1 acceptance scenarios.

## M6 — Methods section (OGC-750) ✅ mounted in the editor

The Methods backend was ported in M0 and hardened in #3714 (13 integration + 6
security tests). M6 **mounts** the existing `MethodsSection.jsx` into the editor
shell — port-verification, not reimplementation. The component moved from
`admin/testManagementConfigMenu/` to `admin/testCatalog/sections/` (its
`utils/Utils` import depth adjusted from `../../` to `../../../`) and is rendered
by `TestCatalogEditor.jsx` when the `methods` SideNav section is active. It calls
the unchanged `/rest/test/{testId}/methods` API — the editor's `/rest/test-catalog`
base does **not** apply to methods (R10/R15).

**Independent Test (M6)**: open the editor for a test → click **Methods** → the
linked-methods table renders; **Link Method** opens the picker; **Create New
Method** reveals the inline form; the default radio and remove act on the link.
Frontend coverage: `MethodsSection.test.jsx` (render OGC-954; set-default PATCH +
remove DELETE OGC-956; inline-create reveal OGC-955) + the editor mount assertion
in `TestCatalogEditor.test.jsx`. The submit-payload contracts (link /
inline-create / copy) — gated behind Carbon's DatePicker/ComboBox, impractical to
drive in jsdom — are covered against a real DB by
`TestMethodRestControllerIntegrationTest`.

## M9 — E2E video proof (OGC-949) — in progress

Playwright specs that assert the core user stories end-to-end **and** record a
video (stakeholder proof). Specs live in `frontend/playwright/tests/demo/core/`,
auto-registered by the `**/demo/core/**` glob in `playwright.config.ts`.

- **Asserting check (CI-safe):** `npm run pw:test:core-demo`
- **Record the videos:** `npm run pw:test:core-demo-video` → videos at
  `frontend/test-results/<test>/video.webm`, screenshot evidence at
  `frontend/e2e-evidence/`.
- Specs reuse `createDemoPresentation` (title / step / scene cards + `evidence()`)
  and stable hooks: `data-cy="test-row-*"`, `data-cy="section-*"`,
  `data-testid="add-component"` / `"methods-section"`, `#basic-info-name`.

**Shipped:** `ogc-949-test-catalog-editor.spec.ts` — US3 (list) → open editor →
US4 (Basic Info) → US5 (Sample & Results, incl. add-component) → US6 (Methods),
kept non-mutating so it is safely repeatable. **Pending M7/M8:** US7 (Ranges +
activation gate) and US8 (Storage) videos.

## Milestone elaboration protocol (M2–M12)

Each section milestone is **story-level** in tasks.md until it starts. When you
pick it up:

1. Create `feat/ogc-949-m{N}-{desc}` from develop; open a draft PR.
2. Run the **ELABORATE gate**: re-run `/speckit.tasks` scoped to that milestone to
   expand its Jira-story tasks into TDD sub-tasks and extend
   `contracts/openapi.yaml` with that section's request/response schemas. Append a
   `## M{N}` subsection to this quickstart with the section's Independent Test.
3. Only then begin implementation tasks (tests first).

> v2 milestones (M13–M20) are not elaborated here; they require a `/speckit.plan`
> revision at v2 kickoff before any tasks exist.
