# Feature Specification: Westgard QC Rules Dashboard

> **Analyzer-boundary amendment (2026-08-24):** This specification governs
> OpenELIS operational Quality Control: control lots, QC results, statistics,
> Westgard evaluation, violations, alerts, and their user workflows. Its older
> per-analyzer editable identification-rule design is superseded by the
> [OGC-1054 authoritative roadmap](../roadmaps/ogc-1054-analyzer-feature-roadmap.md).
> Control-result recognition is immutable behavior of the pinned Bridge profile
> revision. `AnalyzerQcRule`, profile-to-rule copying, and OpenELIS-pushed
> classifiers are not part of the target architecture and must not be extended.

## Executive Summary

Laboratory instruments produce quality control (QC) measurements alongside
patient samples to verify that the analytical system is performing correctly.
This feature provides automated Westgard rule evaluation, a real-time compliance
dashboard, Levey-Jennings control charts, and configurable alerting — replacing
a fully manual, paper-based QC process.

The system identifies QC samples automatically (via configurable rules evaluated
by the analyzer bridge before results reach OpenELIS), persists QC measurements
with statistical context, evaluates 8 standard Westgard rules asynchronously,
and surfaces compliance status through a color-coded dashboard with drill-down
charts and violation tracking.

---

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 — Lab Technician Monitors Instrument Compliance (Priority: P1)

A lab technician starts their shift and opens the QC dashboard to check whether
all instruments are in compliance. They see a summary showing how many
instruments are compliant (green), have warnings (yellow), or are out of
compliance (red). They click on a yellow instrument card to see which Westgard
rule triggered the warning, review the Levey-Jennings chart to understand the
trend, and decide whether to re-run the control.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary daily workflow for QC monitoring.
Without it, technicians have no digital visibility into instrument compliance.

**Independent Test**: Navigate to the QC dashboard, verify summary tiles show
counts, verify instrument cards display status, click a card and verify the
detail page shows violations and a chart.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** QC results have been ingested for 3 instruments, **When** the
   technician opens the QC dashboard, **Then** summary tiles show the correct
   count of compliant/warning/out-of-compliance instruments.
2. **Given** an instrument has a 1-2s warning violation, **When** the technician
   clicks the instrument card, **Then** the detail page shows the violation with
   the rule code, severity, z-score, and the affected result.
3. **Given** the dashboard is open, **When** 5 minutes elapse, **Then** the
   dashboard auto-refreshes with updated data.

---

### User Story 2 — QC Officer Sets Up a New Control Lot (Priority: P1)

When a new lot of QC control material arrives, the QC officer creates a control
lot in the system, selecting the test and instrument it applies to, the
manufacturer's lot number, expiry date, and the statistical calculation method
(initial runs, rolling window, or manufacturer-provided values). For
manufacturer-provided values, the mean and SD are entered immediately and the
lot activates. For initial-runs or rolling methods, the lot enters an
"establishment" phase where it collects enough data points before activating.

**Why this priority**: Without control lots, no QC results can be evaluated.
This is a prerequisite for all Westgard rule evaluation.

**Independent Test**: Navigate to the control lot setup page, fill out the form,
save, verify the lot appears in the list with the correct status (ESTABLISHMENT
for initial/rolling, ACTIVE for manufacturer-fixed).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the QC officer selects "Manufacturer Fixed" as the calculation
   method, **When** they enter mean and SD and save, **Then** the lot is created
   with ACTIVE status and statistics are immediately available.
2. **Given** the QC officer selects "Initial Runs" with N=20, **When** they save
   without entering manufacturer values, **Then** the lot is created with
   ESTABLISHMENT status and a message indicates how many runs are needed.
3. **Given** an ESTABLISHMENT lot has accumulated 20 QC results, **When** the
   officer activates the lot, **Then** statistics are calculated from the
   initial runs and the lot transitions to ACTIVE.

---

### User Story 3 — Automatic QC Detection from Analyzer Files (Priority: P1)

When the analyzer bridge processes analyzer traffic, it uses only the exact
pinned profile revision's explicit control-result recognition behavior to
distinguish control results from patient results. Control results are tagged
before they reach OpenELIS. OpenELIS routes tagged results to the QC pipeline,
computes z-scores, and triggers Westgard rule evaluation.

**Why this priority**: This is the data intake path. Without automatic QC
identification, no results flow into the Westgard evaluation engine.

**Independent Test**: Drop a file with a control sample (e.g., specimen ID
"CNEG001") into a FILE analyzer's watched directory. Verify the system tags it
as QC, creates a QC result, and (if the lot is active) runs Westgard evaluation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a QuantStudio Excel file contains rows with Task="STANDARD",
   **When** the bridge processes the file, **Then** those rows are identified as
   QC control samples.
2. **Given** the pinned profile explicitly declares that the analyzer does not
   transmit controls, **When** traffic is processed, **Then** no result is
   classified as a control and Bridge does not guess.
3. **Given** a QC-tagged result arrives and the control lot is ACTIVE, **When**
   the result is persisted, **Then** a z-score is computed and Westgard rules
   are evaluated without blocking the result ingestion pipeline.

---

### User Story 4 — Lab Manager Reviews Levey-Jennings Chart (Priority: P2)

The lab manager opens the control chart for a specific instrument/test
combination to review QC performance over time. The Levey-Jennings chart shows
each QC result plotted chronologically, with reference lines for the mean and
plus/minus 1, 2, 3 standard deviations. Points that violated Westgard rules are
highlighted with tooltip details.

**Why this priority**: The L-J chart is the standard clinical laboratory
visualization for QC trending. It's essential for ISO 15189 compliance but can
function as a read-only view after the core pipeline (Stories 1-3) works.

**Independent Test**: Navigate to a control lot's chart page, verify the chart
renders with data points, reference lines, and violation markers.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a control lot has 30 QC results, **When** the manager opens the
   chart, **Then** all 30 points are plotted with mean and SD reference lines.
2. **Given** a result with z=3.5 triggered the 1-3s rule, **When** the chart
   renders, **Then** that point is visually highlighted as a violation.

---

### User Story 5 — Lab Supervisor Configures Westgard Rules (Priority: P2)

The lab supervisor opens the rule configuration panel and enables or disables
specific Westgard rules for each test-instrument combination. They can set
whether each rule is a "warning" (informational) or "rejection" (requires
action), and whether corrective action is required. A default multi-rule preset
is available to apply in one click.

**Why this priority**: Configuration is needed for customization but the system
ships with sensible defaults. Most labs can use the preset without manual
configuration.

**Independent Test**: Navigate to the rule config panel, verify it shows
test-instrument pairs with enabled rules, toggle a rule, verify the change
persists.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new test-instrument pair, **When** the supervisor creates a
   control lot, **Then** all 8 Westgard rules are auto-enabled with default
   severity settings.
2. **Given** the supervisor disables a specific rule, **When** the next QC
   result is evaluated, **Then** that rule is skipped.

---

### User Story 6 — Lab Supervisor Receives Violation Alerts (Priority: P2)

When a Westgard rule is violated, the system creates an in-app alert. Rejection-
severity violations fire immediately. Warning-severity violations are batched in
15-minute windows to prevent alert fatigue. The supervisor sees alerts on the
dashboard's Alerts tab and can acknowledge them.

**Why this priority**: Alerts close the feedback loop — without them, violations
exist in the system but nobody is notified.

**Independent Test**: Trigger a rejection-severity violation, verify an alert
appears in the Alerts tab within seconds, verify the acknowledge action works.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a QC result triggers a rejection-severity rule, **When** the
   evaluation completes, **Then** an alert appears immediately for active users.
2. **Given** two warning-severity violations occur within the same 15-minute
   batch window for the same instrument/test, **When** the window closes,
   **Then** a single consolidated alert is sent (not one alert per violation).
3. **Given** the supervisor acknowledges a violation, **When** they refresh the
   dashboard, **Then** the violation shows as resolved.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a QC result arrives but no matching control lot exists? The
  result is stored but not routed to QC processing. An error record is created
  for review.
- What happens when a lot is still in ESTABLISHMENT phase? Results are stored
  and contribute to statistics accumulation, but Westgard rules are NOT
  evaluated (no z-score baseline available yet).
- What happens when a published profile explicitly declares no transmitted
  controls? Bridge classifies no result as a control and does not guess. A
  missing or invalid recognition declaration is a profile-contract error, not
  an implicit patient-result default.
- What happens if rule evaluation fails (e.g., database timeout)? The QC result
  is already saved. The evaluation failure is logged but does not block the
  analyzer ingestion pipeline.
- What happens when a control lot expires? The lot transitions to EXPIRED
  status. New QC results cannot be linked to it. A new lot must be created.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

**QC Identification**

- **FR-001**: Bridge MUST use only the exact pinned profile revision's explicit
  control-result recognition behavior before results reach OpenELIS.
- **FR-002**: Recognition MUST be profile-owned and data-driven. OpenELIS MUST
  NOT publish an analyzer classifier or maintain a per-analyzer recognition
  override.
- **FR-003**: A profile MUST explicitly declare recognition rules or affirm
  that the analyzer transmits no controls. Missing declarations and nonmatches
  MUST NOT trigger a hidden fallback.
- **FR-004**: Identified QC observations MUST be clearly marked in the data
  pipeline so they are routed to QC processing rather than patient result
  acceptance.

**QC Result Processing**

- **FR-005**: The system MUST route identified QC observations to the QC result
  processing pipeline automatically.
- **FR-006**: Each QC result MUST be associated with a control lot, test, and
  instrument.
- **FR-007**: A z-score MUST be computed for each QC result using the lot's
  current mean and standard deviation.
- **FR-008**: Z-score computation MUST be skipped when the lot is in its
  establishment phase (insufficient baseline data).

**Control Lot Management**

- **FR-009**: The system MUST support three statistical calculation methods:
  initial establishment (first N runs), rolling window, and manufacturer-
  provided fixed values.
- **FR-010**: Control lots MUST transition through a defined lifecycle:
  ESTABLISHMENT (collecting data) to ACTIVE (evaluating rules) to
  EXPIRED/ARCHIVED (retired).
- **FR-011**: Lots using manufacturer-provided values MUST activate immediately
  upon creation.

**Westgard Rule Evaluation**

- **FR-012**: The system MUST evaluate 8 standard Westgard rules: 1-2s
  (warning), 1-3s (rejection), 2-2s (rejection), R-4s (rejection), 3-1s
  (warning), 4-1s (rejection), 7-t (warning), 10-x (rejection).
- **FR-013**: Rule evaluation MUST run without blocking the analyzer result
  ingestion pipeline.
- **FR-014**: Each Westgard rule MUST be independently configurable
  (enable/disable, severity, requires-corrective-action flag) per
  test-instrument combination. The `requires_corrective_action` flag is
  persisted in v1 but enforcement of corrective-action workflows begins in M2
  (see v2+ roadmap).
- **FR-015**: The system MUST provide a default rule preset applied
  automatically when a control lot is created.

**Dashboard & Visualization**

- **FR-016**: The QC dashboard MUST display summary tiles showing counts of
  compliant, warning, and out-of-compliance instruments using color coding.
- **FR-017**: Each instrument MUST be represented as a clickable card showing
  compliance status, triggered rules, and last QC timestamp.
- **FR-018**: Levey-Jennings charts MUST plot QC results chronologically with
  reference lines for mean and standard deviation boundaries.
- **FR-019**: Points on charts that triggered rule violations MUST be visually
  distinguished from normal points.
- **FR-020**: The dashboard MUST auto-refresh at a regular interval.

**Alerts**

- **FR-021**: Rejection-severity violations MUST generate immediate in-app
  alerts.
- **FR-022**: Warning-severity violations MUST be batched to prevent alert
  fatigue.
- **FR-023**: Users MUST be able to acknowledge violations from the alerts view.

**Navigation**

- **FR-024**: The analyzer form, QC rules page, and instrument detail view MUST
  be full pages with breadcrumb navigation (not modal dialogs).

### Constitution Compliance Requirements (OpenELIS Global)

- **CR-001**: UI components MUST use Carbon Design System (@carbon/react)
- **CR-002**: All UI strings MUST be internationalized via React Intl
- **CR-003**: Backend MUST follow 5-layer architecture (Valueholder, DAO,
  Service, Controller, Form)
- **CR-004**: Database schema changes MUST use Liquibase changesets; runtime
  configuration (QC rules, control lots) MUST come from the application layer,
  not from Liquibase seed data
- **CR-005**: QC data flowing between systems MUST use FHIR R4 conventions
- **CR-007**: Role-based access control with audit trail (user tracking and
  timestamps on all QC entities)
- **CR-008**: Tests MUST cover unit, integration, and E2E levels

### Key Entities

- **QC Control Lot**: A specific lot of QC control material, scoped to a
  test-instrument pair. Tracks lifecycle status (establishment, active, expired)
  and statistical calculation method. Anchor for all QC measurements.
- **QC Result**: A single QC measurement with value, computed z-score,
  timestamp, and evaluation status (pending, accepted, rejected).
- **QC Statistics**: Cached mean and standard deviation for a control lot,
  recalculated per the lot's chosen method.
- **Westgard Rule Configuration**: Per test-instrument toggle for each of the 8
  Westgard rules, with severity and corrective-action flags.
- **QC Rule Violation**: An immutable audit record created when a rule triggers,
  linking the triggering result and any related historical results.
- **QC Alert**: Notification record per user per violation, with read/unread
  tracking and batching for warnings.
- **Control-result recognition**: Immutable behavior of the pinned Bridge
  profile revision that identifies transported control results. It is separate
  from OpenELIS operational Quality Control and has no per-analyzer OpenELIS
  editor or entity.

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Lab technicians can assess instrument compliance status within 10
  seconds of opening the QC dashboard.
- **SC-002**: QC results from analyzer files are automatically identified and
  evaluated without manual data entry (for instruments with configured rules).
- **SC-003**: Westgard rule violations appear as alerts within 1 minute of the
  QC result being ingested.
- **SC-004**: Levey-Jennings charts render correctly with reference lines and
  violation markers for control lots with 5+ data points.
- **SC-005**: Control lot form submission completes in under 2 minutes per lot.
  MANUFACTURER_FIXED lots activate on save; INITIAL_RUNS and ROLLING lots remain
  in ESTABLISHMENT until the lab has accumulated enough real QC results (no
  fixed calendar-time target — establishment is data-driven).
- **SC-006**: All QC data is auditable — no QC result or violation can be
  deleted, only resolved or archived.
- **SC-007**: The QC evaluation pipeline does not degrade analyzer result
  ingestion performance.

## Assumptions & Constraints

- The analyzer bridge is always in the communication path between analyzers and
  OpenELIS. QC identification happens on the bridge side.
- Control-result recognition is defined and executed by the pinned Bridge
  profile revision. OpenELIS does not seed or push classifier rules.
- v1 delivers in-app alerts only. Email and real-time push notifications are
  deferred to v2.
- v1 does not include corrective action workflows (recalibration, maintenance
  tracking, task assignment). Violations can be acknowledged/resolved but
  without typed corrective action categories.
- v1 does not include manual QC recording (the analyzer-manual-qc spec is a
  separate feature for instruments that run manual tests).
- v1 does not include trend analysis, reporting/export, or advanced chart
  interactions (zoom, pan, export to PDF).
- The system targets CLIA/CAP QC requirements and ISO 15189 audit trail
  standards.

## v1 Implementation Status

PR #3390 implemented the OpenELIS operational-QC foundation and also introduced
the superseded `AnalyzerQcRule` path. The control-lot, QC-result, statistics,
Westgard, violation, alert, and dashboard work remains the operational
foundation. OGC-1054 removes the classifier entity, service, controller, user
interface, profile-copy behavior, and Bridge fallback before analyzer MVP
acceptance. Historical test counts do not prove that removal or current user
acceptance.
