# Deterministic Tasks: M3 Reference and Mapping Administration

## Phase 1 - Contract and TDD

- [x] T001 Create clean milestone worktree and branch from deployed M2 SHA.
- [x] T002 Reconcile Jira, openelis-work, and current repo state in `research.md`.
- [x] T003 Lock behavior-only acceptance criteria in `spec.md`.
- [x] T004 Add failing service tests for organism/antibiotic validation, uniqueness,
      deactivation impact, and reactivation.
- [x] T005 Add failing service/integration tests for immutable AST panel versions.
- [x] T006 Add failing breakpoint lifecycle/activation tests, including one active
      standard per publisher and historical-run preservation.
- [x] T007 Add failing CSV preview/apply tests for mixed-validity rows,
      idempotency, and local customization protection.
- [x] T007A Execute the PostgreSQL transaction-rollback proof in a Docker-capable
      environment.
- [x] T008 Add failing controller tests for admin authorization and
      authenticated-actor derivation.
- [x] T009 Extend ORM and Liquibase update/rollback tests before implementation.

## Phase 2 - Backend

- [x] T010 Add the M9 Liquibase changelog with rollback for accepted model fields,
      panel versions, breakpoint lifecycle/import metadata, and activation audit.
- [x] T011 Extend existing valueholders and add activation-event valueholder.
- [x] T012 Add typed DAO queries and natural-key/reference-impact checks.
- [x] T013 Implement compiled admin list/detail DTOs and query forms.
- [x] T014 Implement `MicrobiologyReferenceAdminService` validation and writes.
- [x] T015 Implement immutable AST panel version publication.
- [x] T016 Implement breakpoint activation and archive safeguards.
- [x] T017 Implement CSV preview, failed-row download, and valid-row application.
- [x] T018 Add admin REST contracts; preserve existing workflow lookup contracts.
- [x] T019 Extend service-created UAT fixtures with synthetic M3 records.

## Phase 3 - Carbon Administration UI

- [x] T020 Add shared route/query utilities and unit tests.
- [x] T021 Add config-driven Admin sidenav sections and route tests.
- [x] T022 Build shared Carbon reference-admin table and status components.
- [x] T023 Build organism and antibiotic list/edit/deactivate workflows.
- [x] T024 Build versioned AST panel editor with ordered tier/report behavior.
- [x] T025 Build culture-Method configuration surface without a duplicate Method
      vocabulary.
- [x] T026 Build breakpoint standard list, rule detail, local-correction,
      activation, and archive UI.
- [x] T027 Build CSV preview/results/error-download UI.
- [x] T028 Add linkable PageBreadCrumb paths and canonical URL preservation.
- [x] T029 Add English i18n keys and focused component/accessibility tests.

## Phase 4 - E2E And Validation

- [x] T030 Register focused Playwright `core-app` projects/tests before browser runs.
- [x] T031 Prove organism/antibiotic edits and deactivation behavior.
- [x] T032 Prove AST panel versioning and historical-run preservation.
- [x] T033 Prove breakpoint activation and mixed-validity import.
- [x] T034 Prove canonical URL reload, Back/Forward, sidenav, and breadcrumbs.
- [x] T036 Run focused backend, ORM, migration, component, Playwright, formatting,
      and `git diff --check` validation.
- [x] T037 Run one pinned `tools/code-qa` alignment, coverage, and simplicity
      review; resolve actionable findings without committing generated reports.
