# OGC-782 Microbiology Execution Roadmap

This is the single execution roadmap and the only delivery-status document for
OGC-782. It is intentionally concise. Detailed implementation history belongs
in Git, pull requests, and immutable evidence reports, not in a second roadmap.

## Authority Chain

1. Repository-owned feature and engineering specifications:
   - [Feature specification](./spec.md)
   - [Engineering plan](./plan.md)
   - [Research](./research.md)
   - [Data model](./data-model.md)
   - [API contract](./contracts/microbiology-openapi.yaml)
   - [Clinical completeness specification](../782-ogc-782-microbiology-m8-clinical-completeness/spec.md)
   - [Reference administration specification](../782-ogc-782-microbiology-m9-reference-mapping-admin/spec.md)
   - [WHONET export specification](../782-ogc-782-microbiology-m10-whonet-export/spec.md)
2. This roadmap, derived from those specifications.
3. [OpenELIS Work microbiology artifacts](https://github.com/DIGI-UW/openelis-work/tree/main/designs/microbiology)
   for functional requirements, workflows, mocks, and visual intent only.

OpenELIS Work does not dictate schema, APIs, routes, component structure, or
service ownership. When its functional intent differs from repository specs,
record the ambiguity here and obtain a product ruling before implementation.

Grist is the live source of truth for UAT. Do not copy changing story totals,
step totals, titles, or checklist revisions into repository specifications.
An exported review report may retain its exact revision as immutable acceptance
evidence.

Dated evidence reports, older gap analyses, slice-status notes, code-qa output,
and subordinate milestone task ledgers are review artifacts. Do not commit or
maintain them as parallel status documents.

## Roadmap Principles

These principles govern every future OGC-782 iteration and change only through
an explicit product or engineering ruling:

1. **Repository specifications are authoritative.** Product behavior belongs
   in `spec.md`; technical design belongs in `plan.md` and its supporting
   repository specifications.
2. **This roadmap is the single execution control.** Maintain current scope,
   order, blockers, and coarse delivery state here. Do not create or revive a
   second status ledger.
3. **OpenELIS Work is functional and visual input only.** Use it to understand
   actors, workflows, interactions, and visual intent. Do not inherit its table,
   API, route, class, ownership, or storage suggestions as requirements.
4. **Resolve drift into the repository spec.** When OpenELIS Work changes or
   conflicts with implemented behavior, identify the product implication and
   reconcile `spec.md` before changing code. Ask Piotr when the intended
   behavior is genuinely ambiguous.
5. **Do not mirror transient metadata.** Commit identifiers, deployment
   identifiers, test totals, Grist revisions, and checklist inventories belong
   in their native systems or immutable acceptance reports, not in living specs,
   the roadmap, or PR prose.
6. **Grist owns live UAT.** Repository tests prove Review integration and
   application behavior; they do not duplicate the current Grist catalog.
7. **PR descriptions are snapshots derived from this roadmap.** Keep them
   concise and update them when scope, blockers, deployment state, or human
   acceptance materially changes, not after every commit or test run.
8. **Evidence is immutable, not operational.** Prior gap analyses, visual
   comparisons, code-qa reports, videos, and exported UAT reports remain useful
   evidence but never compete with this roadmap for current status.
9. **Validation must be proportional.** Use focused TDD, relevant integration
   and Playwright coverage, and one meaningful slice-level code-qa pass. Avoid
   repetitive validation and bookkeeping that do not reduce implementation or
   acceptance risk.
10. **Only runtime value justifies deployment.** Develop and validate locally;
    deploy a coherent user-visible slice for review, never documentation-only or
    test-only changes.

## Iteration Status

This roadmap uses three visible iteration markers:

- `[x]` means the repository iteration is finished.
- `[*]` means the single iteration currently being worked.
- `[ ]` means a future iteration that has not started.

Change a marker only when an iteration starts or finishes. There is no parallel
status table. Merge, deployment, and human-UAT state stay in GitHub, the review
host, and Grist respectively.

### Finished Iterations

- [x] **Routine bacteriology MVP (#3789)** - Test configuration, order routing,
  case workbench, isolates, manual AST, shared worklist, critical communication,
  report propagation, final lock, and WHONET readiness.
- [x] **Clinical completeness (#3972)** - Amendment and re-identification
  history, repeat/retest AST, reagent/card-lot traceability, and initial NFR
  qualification.
- [x] **Reference administration (#3981)** - Organism and antibiotic
  vocabularies, AST panel versions, culture defaults, breakpoint lifecycle, and
  guarded import.
- [x] **WHONET export (#3984)** - Readiness, mapping repair, preview, and audited
  manual CSV export.
- [x] **Functional alignment (#4004)** - Supported order flow, complete bench
  workflow, AST provenance and review, shared Culture/AST worklist, reagent
  selection, and accessibility/security corrections.

### Completed Baseline

- [x] **R2 baseline reconciliation (#4051)** - Establish one authoritative
  roadmap, align the durable specifications and PR snapshot, and add the
  approved no-growth review/release behavior to functional artifacts and live
  UAT without changing application behavior.

This iteration is complete because:

- The authority chain, repository spec, engineering plan, OpenELIS Work
  functional intent, roadmap, and PR snapshot agree.
- Repository tracing confirms that recording no growth is audited and
  review-ready without publishing, while supervisor release projects the final
  negative and locks the case.
- One dedicated, reviewer-executable Grist story uses its own service-created
  fixture and is verified in the live AMR Review overlay.
- The reconciliation is committed and pushed with a clean worktree.

This baseline does not change application behavior, deploy, or watch CI.

Macro Library is a separate OGC-788 product stack, not another OGC-782
iteration. Microbiology consumes approved clinical macros after that shared
capability is available; it does not own macro authoring or administration.

### Approved No-Growth Behavior

1. On an incubating case, **Record no growth** records the authenticated actor,
   time, and bench outcome in the case history.
2. Recording no growth moves the case to a review-ready state and creates no
   patient result or final report.
3. The case clearly presents the separate next action to review and release the
   final negative report.
4. A user without final-release authority cannot release the report, and a
   submitted actor identifier cannot replace the authenticated actor.
5. An authorized reviewer can release the final negative report through the
   standard patient-report path.
6. Final release records the reviewer and time, publishes the negative result,
   and locks culture, isolate, AST, and protocol mutation.
7. The case route and active section remain bookmarkable and refresh-stable;
   keyboard focus and status announcements follow existing Carbon patterns.

## Roadmap Status

### Phase 1A Closure

- [x] **No-growth deterministic acceptance proof** - Add focused service,
  Carbon, and registered `core-app` Playwright coverage for the approved
  no-growth path without arbitrary waits or forced actions. Change runtime code
  only if this evidence exposes a real defect; do not deploy test-only changes.
- [ ] **Accept the current stack** - Complete human UAT in Grist, remediate real
   findings in manageable slices, and merge the stack bottom-up.
- [x] **Supported order-save integration proof** - Add the missing direct
   integration test around the complete supported save path without SQL,
   fixed primary keys, or DAO bypass.
- [x] **Clinical and NFR qualification evidence** - Establish statistically
   meaningful representative-volume measurements and complete the automated
   keyboard/screen-reader review, fixing defects exposed by that evidence.
- [ ] **Shared offline/conflict behavior** - Adopt an application-wide offline
  pattern when its ownership is agreed; do not build a microbiology-only queue.
- [ ] **Analyzer ingress security** - Introduce a least-privilege Bridge service
   identity and prove legitimate delivery plus unrelated-user denial. Coordinate
   this with the analyzer workstream rather than inventing an AMR-only role.
- [ ] **Reagent policy dependency** - Enforce required, optional, and substitute
   reagent behavior only after Test Catalog provides an authoritative shared
   policy model; do not infer it from legacy role names.
- [x] **Reviewed AST worklist behavior** - Remove reviewed attempts from the
  default action queue, retain them in a bookmarkable Reviewed view with a
  read-only View action, and keep reasoned repeat/retest setup inside the case.

### Phase 1B Clinical Depth

- [ ] Implement expert rules and macro-driven bench workflows after the shared
   Macro Library consumer contract is available.
- [*] Complete analyzer-result review and QC with representative instrument
  traffic and reconciliation evidence.
- [ ] Complete WHONET packaging, remaining vocabulary mappings, scheduling, and
   delivery beyond the current manual export.
- [ ] Complete any remaining reference-data administration required by those
   workflows.

### Full Module

- [ ] Operational mycobacteriology/TB workflow (M-14).
- [ ] Antibiogram reporting (M-13).
- [ ] GLASS reporting through consolidated FHIR after routine bacteriology,
   WHONET, and TB outputs are stable.
- [ ] Catalog subscription or cross-site distribution capabilities as separate
   platform work, consumed by microbiology rather than owned by it.

## Iteration Contract

For every implementation slice:

1. Read the relevant repository specification and this roadmap.
2. Compare only the affected workflow and mock in OpenELIS Work.
3. If behavior is ambiguous or contradictory, record one concise clarification
   here and ask Piotr before coding. Do not guess from Jira or implementation
   language in a mock.
4. Write focused failing tests at the service/controller/component/E2E levels
   appropriate to the behavior.
5. Implement the smallest coherent change using existing OpenELIS patterns.
6. Use migrations only for data-model changes. Build test fixtures through
   services; never seed feature tests with SQL, fixed IDs, or DAO bypasses.
7. Use Carbon-accessible interactions in frontend tests and Playwright. Wait on
   observable readiness, never arbitrary timeouts.
8. Validate locally before deployment: focused tests, formatting, migration/ORM
   checks when relevant, registered Playwright, and visual comparison for UI.
9. Run `tools/code-qa` once at the completed slice boundary, not as repetitive
   bookkeeping during development.
10. Update Grist for human UAT without copying its changing catalog into the
    repository. Review-tooling behavior changes belong in the review-tooling
    repository.
11. Update one roadmap row and the PR snapshot. Do not create another status
    ledger or rewrite historical evidence.
12. Deploy only when the slice contains reviewable runtime behavior. Do not
    deploy documentation-only or test-only commits.

## PR Snapshot Contract

PR descriptions should contain only:

- the user-visible slice and its place in the stack;
- implemented behavior and explicit exclusions;
- validation categories completed and any real blocker;
- deployment and human-UAT state in plain language;
- links to `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and this roadmap.

Do not copy commit identifiers, deployment identifiers, Grist revisions,
checklist inventories, or continuously changing test totals into PR prose.
