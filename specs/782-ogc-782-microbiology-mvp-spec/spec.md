# Feature Specification: Microbiology MVP Workflow

**Feature Branch**: `spec/782-ogc-782-microbiology-mvp-spec`
**Created**: 2026-06-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a microbiology-specific feature spec that distills the important features from Jira, Confluence, openelis-work specs/mockups, and repo research; reference the proper files; make the product behavior crystal clear for planning and implementation without letting product specs mandate technical implementation details."

## Source References

This feature spec is the product-facing distillation for planning. The detailed
source artifacts remain useful references, but table names, service names,
routes, schemas, and ownership assumptions inside those artifacts are not
binding product requirements.

## Interpretation Rules for Planning

- This spec defines product behavior and acceptance expectations.
- Detailed M-\* source files provide workflow detail and mockup context, but
  implementation-heavy language in them must be filtered through the local
  engineering crosswalk.
- Planning and tasks may choose table names, service boundaries, API shapes,
  routes, migrations, and reuse points, but those choices should not be treated
  as Casey-owned product requirements.
- Mockups are visual workflow references, not implementation contracts.

## MVP Scope Ruling

Jira OGC-782 is the doc-only M-00 umbrella for the full microbiology module.
This feature keeps `782` as its traceability number, but PR #3789 is the single
implementation milestone for an agreed MVP slice across the related M-03,
M-04, M-05, M-07, and M-11 outcomes. It does not claim that the OGC-782 Jira
epic itself is an implementation ticket or that the full 17-epic bundle is
complete.

The merge-blocking MVP is routine bacteriology order routing and order details,
case work, isolate identification, manual AST, worklist navigation, critical
communication, preliminary/final report propagation, and WHONET readiness.
Amendment/re-identification history, reagent/card lot linkage, expert rules,
full WHONET export and mapping UI, operational TB processing, antibiograms, and
GLASS reporting are explicit later work.

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Route a Microbiology Order (Priority: P1)

As an order-entry user, I need a culture-capable ordered test to route itself
into the correct microbiology workflow so that the lab does not miss creating a
case when the clerk forgets to choose a program manually.

**Why this priority**: Without reliable routing, no downstream microbiology
workflow is dependable.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by entering an order that includes a
microbiology culture-capable test and confirming that the microbiology work
appears in the worklist with the correct workflow context.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a test that is configured to start routine bacteriology work,
   **When** the user places an order for that test, **Then** the system
   indicates that a microbiology case will be created and captures the
   microbiology order details needed by the lab.
2. **Given** a test that is not configured for microbiology culture work,
   **When** the user places an order for that test, **Then** the microbiology
   order fields do not appear and no microbiology case is created.
3. **Given** one physical specimen has routine bacteriology work and a sibling
   workflow reserved for TB work, **When** the worklist is reviewed, **Then**
   the system distinguishes both workflow records without requiring duplicate
   accessioning. Completing the TB laboratory workflow is not part of this MVP.

---

### User Story 2 - Work a Bacteriology Case (Priority: P1)

As a microbiology technologist, I need one case surface for a specimen's
bacteriology workup so that I can record culture setup, growth observations,
organism identification, AST readiness, and reporting progress without paper
logs or duplicate transcription.

**Why this priority**: This is the core MVP workflow for running a bacterial
culture from receipt through finalization.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by opening a newly routed case, recording
setup and culture progress, adding an isolate, identifying the organism, and
confirming the case shows the next required action.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a newly created bacteriology case, **When** a technologist opens
   the case, **Then** the case displays specimen, patient, workflow, and next
   action information in a way that supports immediate bench work.
2. **Given** a case in culture setup, **When** the technologist records media or
   bottle setup, **Then** the case moves forward and records who performed the
   action and when.
3. **Given** growth or a positive signal is observed, **When** the technologist
   records the observation, **Then** the case prompts isolate workup and makes
   the event visible in the case history.
4. **Given** an organism has been identified, **When** the technologist marks it
   as clinically significant, **Then** the case supports AST setup for that
   isolate.

---

### User Story 3 - Enter and Review AST (Priority: P1)

As a technologist or supervisor, I need to enter AST readings and see their
susceptibility interpretation so that antibiotic results are calculated,
reviewed, and corrected with an audit trail before reporting.

**Why this priority**: AST is the central clinical value of the bacteriology
MVP.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by entering AST readings for an identified
isolate and confirming interpretations, review state, override behavior, and
report readiness.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an identified significant isolate, **When** the technologist starts
   AST entry, **Then** the system offers the expected antibiotic panel and
   breakpoint context for that organism and specimen.
2. **Given** MIC or zone values are entered, **When** the values are saved,
   **Then** the system displays susceptibility interpretations and clearly
   marks readings that need manual judgment.
3. **Given** a user overrides an interpretation, **When** the override is saved,
   **Then** the original reading remains reviewable and the override requires a
   reason.
4. **Given** AST results have not been reviewed, **When** a supervisor attempts
   final release, **Then** the case is not considered ready for final reporting.

---

### User Story 4 - Work from a Shared Microbiology Queue (Priority: P2)

As an on-shift technologist, I need a shared worklist organized by what needs
action next so that the team can safely work multi-day microbiology cases
without assigning ownership to one person.

**Why this priority**: Microbiology work is shift-based and event-driven; a
shared state-driven queue prevents cases from being overlooked.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating cases in different states and
confirming the worklist groups, filters, highlights, and navigates to the right
case action.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple in-flight cases, **When** the user opens the microbiology
   worklist, **Then** cases are visible by current state and due action.
2. **Given** a case receives a positive signal or AST results become ready for
   review, **When** the worklist refreshes, **Then** that case is visibly
   prioritized for action.
3. **Given** a specimen has sibling bacteriology and TB workflow records,
   **When** the user views the worklist, **Then** both are distinguishable
   without merging their lifecycles or implying that TB bench processing is
   available.

---

### User Story 5 - Release Reports and Log Critical Communications (Priority: P2)

As a technologist or supervisor, I need preliminary/final release readiness and
critical communication logging so that urgent findings are communicated and
reports are released only when required clinical work is complete.

**Why this priority**: Reporting and critical communication are patient-safety
requirements for microbiology.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by logging a critical communication,
releasing a preliminary report from an eligible case, and confirming final
release is blocked until readiness requirements are met.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a critical finding such as a positive sterile-site culture,
   **When** the user logs a critical communication, **Then** the system records
   the target, recipient, message, time, and acknowledgment state.
2. **Given** preliminary information is available, **When** the user releases a
   preliminary report, **Then** the case records the release and keeps the case
   open for later results.
3. **Given** final release is attempted, **When** required isolate, AST, review,
   or critical follow-up work is incomplete, **Then** the system blocks final
   release and explains what remains.

---

### User Story 6 - Prepare Surveillance Outputs (Priority: P3)

As a surveillance officer or lab manager, I need finalized microbiology results
to be export-ready for WHONET so that AMR surveillance reporting can be
performed without rebuilding the same result data manually.

**Why this priority**: Surveillance is a planned extension of the MVP workflow
and must be protected by the core data captured during cases and AST.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by finalizing cases with organism and AST
data and confirming the system can identify which finalized results are ready
or missing mapping for export.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** finalized bacteriology cases with AST results, **When** export
   readiness is checked, **Then** the system identifies included organisms,
   antibiotics, specimen types, and missing mappings.
2. **Given** export is not part of the current release slice, **When** a user
   encounters export actions, **Then** the system makes the planned status clear
   without pretending the capability is complete.

### Edge Cases

- A clerk manually selects Microbiology without a culture-capable test.
- A culture-capable test is ordered without a default culture setup.
- One specimen has both routine bacteriology and TB ordered.
- A case is routed to the wrong workflow and must be corrected before or after
  bench work begins.
- A specimen is lost, contaminated, mislabeled, or rejected after a case exists.
- A case has no growth and needs final negative reporting.
- An isolate is later reidentified after preliminary or final release.
- AST has no matching breakpoint for an organism, drug, specimen, or method.
- AST readings fail QC or require repeat testing.
- Critical communication goes to a clinician not found in the provider
  directory.
- WHONET readiness finds unmapped organisms, antibiotics, specimen types, or
  patient origin codes.
- Large worklists include many open cases and must remain usable by keyboard
  and screen reader users.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a reliable way for ordered tests to start
  the appropriate microbiology workflow without relying on clerk memory.
- **FR-002**: Users MUST be able to capture microbiology order details needed
  for culture setup, including culture setup default, patient origin, number of
  sets, clinical history, antibiotic exposure, and critical notification
  preference.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST distinguish sibling bacteriology and TB workflow
  records for the same physical specimen without duplicate accessioning. This
  MVP does not provide the operational TB laboratory workflow.
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to open a microbiology case and understand the
  current workflow, specimen context, stage, next action, and prior activity.
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to record culture setup, incubation progress,
  positive or growth observations, no-growth finalization, and specimen-loss or
  rejection events.
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to create and update isolates, record organism
  identification, record clinical significance, and distinguish preliminary
  from final organism identification.
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to set up AST only when the isolate context is
  sufficient to support interpretation.
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to enter manual AST readings and see
  susceptibility interpretation, including clear guidance when no standard
  breakpoint is available.
- **FR-010**: Users MUST be able to override AST interpretations with a reason
  while preserving the original reading for audit and review.
- **FR-011**: Users MUST be able to repeat or retest AST without overwriting the
  prior run or hiding the reason for repeat testing.
- **FR-012**: The system MUST provide a shared microbiology worklist organized
  by case state, due action, urgency, and review need rather than per-case
  ownership.
- **FR-013**: The worklist MUST be discoverable from configured primary
  navigation and allow users to filter, sort, and open cases or AST work that
  needs action.
- **FR-014**: The system MUST make sibling workflow records on the same specimen
  distinguishable in the worklist while keeping their lifecycles and reports
  separate.
- **FR-015**: Users MUST be able to release preliminary reports when eligible
  and final reports only when readiness checks pass.
- **FR-017**: Users MUST be able to log critical communications for case,
  isolate, sample, or result context, including recipient, message, time,
  method, acknowledgment state, and follow-up.
- **FR-018**: Critical communications MUST surface through the existing
  operational alerts workflow rather than a parallel alerts experience, and an
  acknowledgment from either workflow MUST remain synchronized.
- **FR-019**: The system MUST support reference data needed for MVP
  microbiology work: organisms, antibiotics, AST panels, culture setup recipes,
  breakpoint standards, patient origin, and specimen mapping.
- **FR-020**: The system MUST prepare finalized microbiology data for WHONET
  surveillance export by tracking export-relevant organism, specimen,
  antibiotic, breakpoint, and interpretation information.
- **FR-021**: Phase 1A MUST support manual bacteriology workflow end-to-end;
  analyzer automation, expert rules, full WHONET export, TB workflow, and GLASS
  reporting may be planned extensions unless included in an explicit later
  slice.
- **FR-022**: Product specs and Jira tickets for this feature MUST describe
  workflow behavior and acceptance outcomes, not required table names, service
  names, route names, or storage layout.
- **FR-023**: Worklist and case destinations MUST preserve bookmarkable,
  refresh-stable filter, sort, and active-section context, including when a
  user opens a case and returns to the worklist.

### Deferred Product Outcomes

These outcomes remain valid module goals but are not acceptance criteria for
PR #3789:

- **V2-001**: Preserve versioned report history when a final case is amended or
  reidentified. The MVP instead locks final cases against isolate and AST
  mutation.
- **V2-002**: Link reagent/card lots and richer multi-row AST run metadata.
- **V2-003**: Provide full WHONET export and code-mapping administration.
- **V2-004**: Provide operational TB, expert-rule, antibiogram, and GLASS
  workflows.
- **V2-005**: Review analyzer-ingested AST results with mandatory human review
  before final reporting.

Follow-up status: branch
`feat/782-ogc-782-microbiology-m8-clinical-completeness` implements and
qualifies V2-001 plus repeat/retest AST and policy-neutral reagent/card-lot
traceability from V2-002. The required/optional/substitute policy remains open
because existing Test Catalog roles cannot safely supply it. This status note
does not change PR #3789's historical MVP acceptance boundary; none of the
follow-up behavior is claimed as part of that milestone until its own branch is
merged.

Branch `feat/782-ogc-782-microbiology-m9-reference-mapping-admin` implements the
M-01/M-02 administration slice: organism and antibiotic vocabularies, immutable
AST panel versions, culture defaults on the existing Method vocabulary,
breakpoint lifecycle, protected local corrections, and guarded CSV import. M1,
M2, and M3 are deployed together for review, but remain an open PR stack and
have not completed human UAT.

The delivered stack is not the full microbiology module. Full WHONET export and
mapping, expert rules, macro workflows, richer worklist/dashboard depth,
analyzer-ingested AST, operational TB, antibiograms, GLASS reporting, catalog
subscription, and the remaining OGC-783 NFRs remain follow-up work.

### Constitution Compliance Requirements (OpenELIS Global)

- **CR-001**: UI components MUST use Carbon Design System v1.15+ exclusively.
- **CR-002**: All user-facing strings MUST be internationalized via React Intl;
  new source strings go in `en.json`.
- **CR-003**: Backend implementation MUST follow the OpenELIS 5-layer
  architecture and keep transaction ownership in services.
- **CR-004**: Database changes MUST use Liquibase changesets with rollback for
  structural changes.
- **CR-005**: External healthcare interoperability MUST use FHIR R4/IHE-aligned
  patterns where applicable.
- **CR-006**: Country or deployment variation MUST be configuration-driven, not
  forked in code.
- **CR-007**: Security, audit trail, role-based access control, and input
  validation are required for clinical and administrative actions.
- **CR-008**: Tests MUST be included for new backend behavior, frontend flows,
  and migration/ORM validity; backend tests use JUnit 4.
- **CR-009**: Because the full module is larger than three days, implementation
  MUST be split into independently verifiable behavior slices. Delivery and
  review structure is defined by the engineering plan, not this product
  contract.

### Key Entities

These are product concepts. Engineering may choose the final storage and API
shape during planning.

- **Microbiology Case**: One microbiology workflow for one physical specimen,
  from receipt through final report. Amendment history is later scope.
- **Workflow Type**: The kind of microbiology work being performed, such as
  routine bacteriology or mycobacteriology/TB.
- **Culture Setup Recipe**: The lab recipe for media, incubation, atmosphere,
  and related setup defaults for a culture test.
- **Case Activity / Timeline**: The chronological record of actions,
  observations, notes, stage changes, and analyzer events associated with a
  case.
- **Isolate**: A distinct organism identified during the case workup, with
  significance and identification history.
- **AST Work**: Susceptibility testing for one isolate, including panel,
  method, readings, interpretations, overrides, review, and repeat testing.
- **Breakpoint Standard**: The versioned rule set used to interpret AST
  readings.
- **Critical Communication**: A clinically required notification and
  acknowledgment record for urgent findings.
- **Microbiology Worklist**: The shared operational queue of microbiology cases
  and AST work requiring attention.
- **Surveillance Export Readiness**: The finalized result and mapping state
  needed to produce WHONET-compatible surveillance output.

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A user can enter a qualifying routine bacteriology order and see
  the resulting microbiology work on the worklist without manual program
  routing.
- **SC-002**: A technologist can complete the MVP bacteriology path from order
  routing through culture setup, isolate identification, manual AST entry,
  review readiness, and report release using one case workflow.
- **SC-003**: A case with incomplete required work cannot be final-released, and
  the user can identify the blocking item without consulting paper logs.
- **SC-004**: A user can distinguish sibling bacteriology and TB workflow
  records for the same specimen in worklist context without implying that the
  TB bench workflow is implemented.
- **SC-005**: AST override history preserves the original reading, the changed
  interpretation, actor, time, and justification.
- **SC-006**: A user can log a critical communication without being blocked by
  incomplete provider directory data.
- **SC-007**: Worklist users can identify urgent positive, growth, and
  AST-review work through visible priority, due-action, filter, and sort
  controls.
- **SC-008**: All MVP user-facing microbiology strings are represented by i18n
  keys and can be rendered in English.
- **SC-009**: Engineering planning can produce implementation tasks without
  needing Casey artifacts to decide schema, API, route, or service ownership.
- **SC-010**: A user can reach the worklist from primary navigation, bookmark a
  filtered view, open a case, refresh either page, and return without losing
  the relevant worklist or case-section context.

PR #3789 did not claim the source M-NFR 200-item worklist and sub-second read
p95 target. The later M8 branch now carries repeatable service-created API and
browser measurements for that target; those follow-up results do not alter the
MVP PR's historical evidence.

## Planning Notes

The following technical directions are currently favored by evidence, but they
belong to planning and task generation rather than this product spec:

- The ordered test should be the source of workflow routing.
- Case identity should be anchored at the physical specimen plus workflow
  level.
- Culture setup should reuse existing method/configuration concepts where
  appropriate.
- AST should reuse existing result/reporting infrastructure where feasible.
- WHONET should extend the existing export path where feasible.
- Critical communication should reuse existing alert surfaces while preserving
  a clinical call/read-back log.

See `specs/roadmaps/analyzer-microbiology-engineering-crosswalk.md` for the
current engineering interpretation and verification gates.
