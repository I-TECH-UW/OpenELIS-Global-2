see [OpenELIS-Docker setup](https://github.com/DIGI-UW/openelis-docker)

### For Running OpenELIS Global2 from Source Code

Development has one supported startup path. From the root of any clone or Git
worktree, run:

```bash
scripts/dev-stack up
```

The command initializes the required submodules, uses Java 21, builds the local
WAR and analyzer components, and starts the complete OpenELIS + analyzer
harness. Its Compose project, containers, images, networks, ports, and volumes
are derived from the worktree path, so multiple worktrees can run concurrently.
The harness analyzer scenarios are created idempotently through authenticated
application services after login readiness; startup never seeds the database
directly. Use `--no-scenarios` only when testing an intentionally empty system.

Useful commands:

```bash
scripts/dev-stack status
scripts/dev-stack url
eval "$(scripts/dev-stack env)"  # configure Playwright for this worktree
scripts/dev-stack logs -f oe.openelis.org
scripts/dev-stack down
scripts/dev-stack down --volumes --yes  # explicit data reset
```

Local development needs no configuration: `.env` is created from `.env.example`,
the proxy binds random loopback ports, and `scripts/dev-stack url` prints the
browser URL. Frontend source remains hot-reloaded. Re-run `scripts/dev-stack up`
after backend or analyzer component changes.

The published development frontend dependency image is reused when
`package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `frontend/Dockerfile` match `develop`;
worktree source is still mounted for hot reload. If any of those inputs differ,
the command automatically builds an isolated frontend image. Set
`DEV_STACK_BUILD_FRONTEND=true` only to force that rebuild.

For a domain-enabled development server, set a real `LETSENCRYPT_DOMAIN` and
`LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL` in `.env`, then run the same `scripts/dev-stack up` command.
It binds ports 80/443, renders the named nginx hosts, and uses the existing
Let's Encrypt HTTP-01 flow. DNS for both the primary domain and
`bridge.<domain>` must resolve to the server. Port and bind overrides are listed
in `.env.example` for hosts that already have an external router; those hosts
should terminate TLS at that router and set `DEV_STACK_TLS=self-signed` for the
private upstream.

Do not invoke the development Compose layers directly. CI, release, and packaged
installation commands remain separate operational interfaces.

| New React UI |       output of `scripts/dev-stack url`        |            admin: adminADMIN! |

**Note:** If your browser indicates that the website is not secure after
accessing any of these links, simply follow these steps:

1. Scroll down on the warning page.
2. Click on the "Advanced" button.
3. Finally, click on "Proceed to https://localhost" to access the development
   environment.

#### Formating the Source code after making changes

1.  After making UI changes to the [frontend](./frontend/) directory , run the
    formatter to properly format the Frontend code

        cd frontend
        npm run format

2.  After making changes to the [backend](./src/) directory, run the formatter
    to properly format the Java code

        mvn spotless:apply

#### To ensure your code passes the same checks as the CI pipeline

**Recommended: Use the CI check scripts** (replicates exact CI workflow):

```bash
# Run backend CI checks (formatting + build + tests)
./scripts/run-ci-checks.sh

# Run frontend CI checks (formatting + unit tests + E2E tests)
./scripts/run-frontend-ci-checks.sh

# Run both (full CI simulation)
./scripts/run-ci-checks.sh && ./scripts/run-frontend-ci-checks.sh
```

**Options:**

- `--skip-submodules`: Skip submodule build (faster, for quick checks)
- `--skip-tests`: Skip tests (formatting only)
- `--skip-e2e`: Skip E2E tests (frontend only)

**Manual commands** (if you prefer to run steps individually):

1.  Run Code Formatting Check (Backend). This command checks code formatting and
    performs validation similar to the CI

        mvn spotless:check

1.  Run Build Check (Backend). This command builds the project similar to CI

        mvn clean install -Dspotless.check.skip=true

1.  To run Individual Integration Test

         mvn verify -Dit.test=<packageName>.<TestClassName>

    **DBUnit test data note:** DB-backed integration tests typically load DBUnit
    Flat XML datasets from `src/test/resources/testdata/` via
    `executeDataSetWithStateManagement("testdata/<file>.xml")`. Prefer datasets
    over inline SQL setup/cleanup to avoid test data pollution.

1.  Run Frontend Formatting, Build, and E2E Test Checks similar to CI

    > **Note:** Frontend checks will only pass successfully if your development
    > environment is properly set up and running without issues.

        cd frontend/ # from project directory
        npm install
        npm run build
        npm run cy:run # this will run e2e testing same CI

### Environmental & Compliance-Scoped Result Evaluation

Environmental orders support multi-standard compliance evaluation. When an order
is placed with one or more compliance standards selected (e.g. PP No. 22/2021,
WHO-DWG-4), the result entry screen shows per-standard PASS/FAIL pills inline
with each test result under a **Status — Per Regulation** column.

**How it works:**

1. Admin configures compliance standards and their per-test thresholds under
   **Administration → Compliance Standards**. Each standard has parameter groups
   with thresholds (RANGE, MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, etc.) linked to specific tests.

2. When placing an environmental order, select the applicable compliance
   standards in the **Applicable Compliance Standards** section. These are
   stored in the `sample_compliance_standards` join table.

3. On result entry, the system evaluates each entered value against the
   `compliance_threshold` rows for that test + standard combination and returns
   `complianceStatuses` (array of `{standardId, standardName, pass}`) alongside
   each result row.

4. The result entry screen renders green `PASS — <standard>` or red
   `FAIL — <standard>` pills. The column is hidden when no compliance standards
   are attached to the loaded result set.

**Key entities:**

- `compliance_standard` — the regulatory standard (e.g. PP No. 22/2021)
- `parameter_group` — groups thresholds within a standard
- `compliance_threshold` — per-test threshold with type and bounds
- `sample_compliance_standards` — join table linking a sample to its standards

Non-environmental and non-compliance orders are unaffected; the existing
normal/abnormal background-colour logic is unchanged.

### Test Data Setup

For E2E testing, integration testing, and manual testing, load test fixtures:

```bash
# Basic usage (loads and verifies automatically)
./src/test/resources/load-test-fixtures.sh --profile=core

# Harness fixture lane (includes HARN-* lane data)
./src/test/resources/load-test-fixtures.sh --profile=harness

# Reset database before loading (clean state)
./src/test/resources/load-test-fixtures.sh --profile=core --reset

# Load without verification (faster)
./src/test/resources/load-test-fixtures.sh --profile=core --no-verify
```

**Note**: The unified loader script provides dependency checks, verification,
and reset capabilities. See
[Test Data Strategy Guide](.specify/guides/test-data-strategy.md) for details.
