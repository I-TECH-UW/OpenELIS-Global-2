### For running OpenELIS Global2 in Docker with default Settings out of the Box

see [OpenELIS-Docker setup](https://github.com/DIGI-UW/openelis-docker)

### For Running OpenELIS Global2 from Source Code

**Prerequisites for all methods below:**

Before running any `docker compose` command, you must create a `.env` file with
your environment configuration:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` to customize settings for your environment (database passwords,
domain, etc.). See `.env.example` for detailed documentation of each variable.

**IMPORTANT:** Never commit `.env` to version control as it contains secrets and
server-specific settings. CI copies `.env.example` to `.env` before running
docker compose.

#### Running OpenELIS Global2 using docker compose With published docker images on dockerhub

    docker compose up -d

#### Running OpenELIS Global2 using docker compose with docker images built directly from the source code

    docker compose -f build.docker-compose.yml up -d --build

#### Running OpenELIS Global2 with docker compose For Development

Here Artifacts (ie the War file and React code) are compiled/built on the local
machine outside docker and just mounted into the docker compose setup. This
speeds up the development process

1.  Fork the
    [OpenELIS-Global Repository](https://github.com/DIGI-UW/OpenELIS-Global-2.git)
    and clone the forked repo. The `username` below is the `username` of your
    Github profile.

         git clone https://github.com/username/OpenELIS-Global-2.git

1.  Initialize and build submodules

        cd OpenELIS-Global-2
        git submodule update --init --recursive
        cd dataexport
        mvn clean install -DskipTests

1.  Navigate back to the repository directory:

         cd ..

1.  Build the War file

          mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dmaven.test.skip=true

1.  Start the containers to mount the locally compiled artifacts

        docker compose -f dev.docker-compose.yml up -d

    Note : For Reflecting Local changes in the Running Containers ;

- Any Changes to the [Front-end](./frontend/) React Source Code will be directly
  Hot Reloaded in the UI
- For changes to the [Back-end](./src/) Java Source code

  - Run the maven build again to re-build the War file

         mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dmaven.test.skip=true

  - Recreate the Openelis webapp container

        docker compose -f dev.docker-compose.yml up -d  --no-deps --force-recreate oe.openelis.org

| Legacy UI    | https://localhost/api/OpenELIS-Global/  |            admin: adminADMIN! |
| New React UI |           https://localhost/            |            admin: adminADMIN! |

**Note:** If your browser indicates that the website is not secure after
accessing any of these links, simply follow these steps:

1. Scroll down on the warning page.
2. Click on the "Advanced" button.
3. Finally, click on "Proceed to https://localhost" to access the development
   environment.

#### Formating the Source code after making changes

1.  After making UI changes to the [frontend](./frontend/) directory , run the
    formatter to properly format the Frontend code

        cd frontend
        npm run format

2.  After making changes to the [backend](./src/) directory, run the formatter
    to properly format the Java code

        mvn spotless:apply

#### To ensure your code passes the same checks as the CI pipeline

**Recommended: Use the CI check scripts** (replicates exact CI workflow):

```bash
# Run backend CI checks (formatting + build + tests)
./scripts/run-ci-checks.sh

# Run frontend CI checks (formatting + unit tests + E2E tests)
./scripts/run-frontend-ci-checks.sh

# Run both (full CI simulation)
./scripts/run-ci-checks.sh && ./scripts/run-frontend-ci-checks.sh
```

**Options:**

- `--skip-submodules`: Skip submodule build (faster, for quick checks)
- `--skip-tests`: Skip tests (formatting only)
- `--skip-e2e`: Skip E2E tests (frontend only)

**Manual commands** (if you prefer to run steps individually):

1.  Run Code Formatting Check (Backend). This command checks code formatting and
    performs validation similar to the CI

        mvn spotless:check

1.  Run Build Check (Backend). This command builds the project similar to CI

        mvn clean install -Dspotless.check.skip=true

1.  To run Individual Integration Test

         mvn verify -Dit.test=<packageName>.<TestClassName>

    **DBUnit test data note:** DB-backed integration tests typically load DBUnit
    Flat XML datasets from `src/test/resources/testdata/` via
    `executeDataSetWithStateManagement("testdata/<file>.xml")`. Prefer datasets
    over inline SQL setup/cleanup to avoid test data pollution.

1.  Run Frontend Formatting, Build, and E2E Test Checks similar to CI

    > **Note:** Frontend checks will only pass successfully if your development
    > environment is properly set up and running without issues.

        cd frontend/ # from project directory
        npm install
        npm run build
        npm run cy:run # this will run e2e testing same CI

### Environmental & Compliance-Scoped Result Evaluation

Environmental orders support multi-standard compliance evaluation. When an order
is placed with one or more compliance standards selected (e.g. PP No. 22/2021,
WHO-DWG-4), the result entry screen shows per-standard PASS/FAIL pills inline
with each test result under a **Status — Per Regulation** column.

**How it works:**

1. Admin configures compliance standards and their per-test thresholds under
   **Administration → Compliance Standards**. Each standard has parameter groups
   with thresholds (RANGE, MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, etc.) linked to specific tests.

2. When placing an environmental order, select the applicable compliance
   standards in the **Applicable Compliance Standards** section. These are
   stored in the `sample_compliance_standards` join table.

3. On result entry, the system evaluates each entered value against the
   `compliance_threshold` rows for that test + standard combination and returns
   `complianceStatuses` (array of `{standardId, standardName, pass}`) alongside
   each result row.

4. The result entry screen renders green `PASS — <standard>` or red
   `FAIL — <standard>` pills. The column is hidden when no compliance standards
   are attached to the loaded result set.

**Key entities:**

- `compliance_standard` — the regulatory standard (e.g. PP No. 22/2021)
- `parameter_group` — groups thresholds within a standard
- `compliance_threshold` — per-test threshold with type and bounds
- `sample_compliance_standards` — join table linking a sample to its standards

Non-environmental and non-compliance orders are unaffected; the existing
normal/abnormal background-colour logic is unchanged.

### Test Data Setup

For E2E testing, integration testing, and manual testing, load test fixtures:

```bash
# Basic usage (loads and verifies automatically)
./src/test/resources/load-test-fixtures.sh --profile=core

# Harness fixture lane (includes HARN-* lane data)
./src/test/resources/load-test-fixtures.sh --profile=harness

# Reset database before loading (clean state)
./src/test/resources/load-test-fixtures.sh --profile=core --reset

# Load without verification (faster)
./src/test/resources/load-test-fixtures.sh --profile=core --no-verify
```

**Note**: The unified loader script provides dependency checks, verification,
and reset capabilities. See
[Test Data Strategy Guide](.specify/guides/test-data-strategy.md) for details.
