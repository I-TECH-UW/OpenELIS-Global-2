# Security Policy

OpenELIS Global is laboratory information system software used in public health
settings. Protecting patient data and laboratory operations is a core project
priority. This document explains how to report security vulnerabilities in
OpenELIS Global 2 and what to expect from the maintainers.

Group at the University of Washington).

For general community conduct, see [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). For
functional bugs and feature requests, use
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/DIGI-UW/OpenELIS-Global-2/issues) — **not**

## Supported versions

Security fixes are provided for supported lines below. Version numbers follow
the project release scheme (for example `3.2.1.9`). See
[Releases](https://github.com/DIGI-UW/OpenELIS-Global-2/releases) for tags and
installer assets.

| Version / line                                                                                         | Supported   | Notes                                                                                 |

| Older `3.2.x` patches superseded by a newer release                                                    | Best effort | Upgrade to the latest `3.2.x` release when possible.                                  |
| `2.x` and earlier major versions                                                                       | No          | End of life; no security support unless explicitly listed in a release notice.        |

If you are unsure whether your deployment is supported, include your **release
tag**, **installer version**, or **`git describe` output** when you report.

## Scope

### In scope

Vulnerabilities in software maintained for OpenELIS Global 2, including when
reasonably exercised in supported deployments:

- This repository (`OpenELIS-Global-2`): application server (Java/Spring), React
  UI, REST APIs, authentication/authorization, session handling, and bundled
  configuration shipped here.
- **Analyzer bridge** when used with OpenELIS Global:
  [DIGI-UW/openelis-analyzer-bridge](https://github.com/DIGI-UW/openelis-analyzer-bridge)
  (report bridge-specific issues to that repository, or note the bridge in your
  report if the issue spans both codebases).
- **Official deployment artifacts** published from this project (for example
  release installers and documented Docker workflows linked from
  [openelis-docker](https://github.com/DIGI-UW/openelis-docker)), when the flaw
  is in OpenELIS-owned images, defaults, or documented configuration — not
  one-off site customization.

### Out of scope

Please use normal support channels (issues, forum, contact form) for:

- General product bugs without demonstrated security impact.
- Misconfigurations on a specific lab server (weak passwords, missing TLS,
  exposed admin ports, outdated OS) unless the **default** documented install is
  unsafe.
- Social engineering, physical access, or denial-of-service without a fixable
  defect in OpenELIS code.
- Third-party services (hosting provider, email, identity provider) except where
  OpenELIS integrates with them in a demonstrably unsafe way.
- Vulnerabilities in dependencies already fixed in a **supported** release; we
  still appreciate reports if the fix is not yet released — coordinate via the
  reporting process below.

## How to report a vulnerability

**Do not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub Issues,
Discussions, or Pull Requests. Public reports can put deployments and patient
data at risk before a fix is available.

### Preferred: GitHub private vulnerability reporting

1. Open
   **[Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/DIGI-UW/OpenELIS-Global-2/security/advisories/new)**
   for this repository (Security → Advisories → **Report a vulnerability**).
2. Provide as much detail as you can (see [What to include](#what-to-include)).

Maintainers use
[GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/DIGI-UW/OpenELIS-Global-2/security/advisories)
for coordinated disclosure when appropriate.

### Alternative: OpenELIS contact form

If you cannot use GitHub private reporting (for example, your account cannot
access Security Advisories), use the official contact form and clearly mark the
submission as a **security vulnerability**:

**[https://openelis-global.org/getting-started/contact/](https://openelis-global.org/getting-started/contact/)**

- **Subject:** `Security vulnerability — OpenELIS Global 2`
- Do **not** paste exploit payloads or patient data into the form; describe
  impact and offer to share details through a safer channel if needed.

For community questions that are not security-sensitive, see
[Get involved](https://openelis-global.org/community/get-involved/).

## What to include

Help us triage quickly:

1. **Affected component** — OpenELIS app, analyzer bridge, FHIR path, plugin,
   etc.
2. **Version** — release tag (for example `v3.2.1.9`), installer version, or
   commit SHA on `develop` / `main`.
3. **Environment** — Docker vs installer, optional modules, bridge enabled or
   not.
4. **Description** — what is wrong and why it is security-relevant.
5. **Reproduction** — minimal steps or proof of concept.
6. **Impact** — confidentiality, integrity, availability; whether authenticated
   access is required.
7. **Suggested fix** (optional).

### Protected health information (PHI)

OpenELIS processes laboratory and patient data. **Never** include real patient
records, accession numbers from production, or live database dumps in a report.
Use synthetic data, local test fixtures, or redacted screenshots only.

## What to expect

| Stage                     | Target                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Acknowledgement           | Within **3 business days**                                 |
| Initial triage / severity | Within **10 business days** when possible                  |
| Fix and advisory          | Depends on severity; we aim for **coordinated disclosure** |

We follow coordinated disclosure: we work with you on a reasonable timeline
before publishing details, typically up to **90 days** from acknowledgement,
unless a shorter or longer window is agreed (for example, active exploitation or
complex fixes).

When a fix is ready, we may:

- Publish a **GitHub Security Advisory** (and credit you if you wish).
- Ship a patch release on `main` and tag a new
  [Release](https://github.com/DIGI-UW/OpenELIS-Global-2/releases).
- Document mitigation steps for administrators in the advisory or release notes.

## Good-faith research

We appreciate good-faith security research conducted against **test
environments** without real patient data. Please follow this policy, use local
or non-production deployments where possible, and avoid impacting live
laboratory operations.

If a flaw spans multiple repositories, report once via OpenELIS Global 2 private
reporting and mention all affected components.
