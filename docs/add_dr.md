# Adding Practitioners into FHIRstore

Ensure OE is set to pull pracrittioners from the Consolidated server by setting
org.openelisglobal.providerlist.fhirstore=https://cs-path:5000/fhir/

# Step 1 : Set up a Connection Through OpenHIM

Communicate through OpenHIM so you can use HTTP Basic auth to authenticate
instead of certs.

Create a client in OpenHIM using the instructions
[here](http://openhim.org/docs/configuration/clients).

- Remember your client ID as it will be your username
- Give the client a role that has access to the FHIRstore channel (most likely
  one of fhir-pusher, fhir-puller, otherwise you will have to add the user to
  the channel as shown [here](http://openhim.org/docs/configuration/channels))
- Configure authentication with Basic Auth, and keep track of your password

Test that your connection works by navigating to or making a GET request to
https://&lt;OpenHIMaddress>:5000/fhir/Practitioner with basic auth properties
set.

You should receive a page of the current Practitioner in JSON format.

# Step 2: Generating a UUID

Because we want to use uuidâ€™s for all our fhir objects, you will need to
generate one. There are many generators online such as
[https://www.uuidgenerator.net/](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/). It is
recommended to use UUID version 4 when generating.

# Step 3: Write your Practitioner in FHIR notation

Below is a template of a FHIR Organization. highlighted fields should be
replaced

{

    "resourceType": "Practitioner",

    "id": "generated uuid",

    "identifier": [

{

"system": "http://openelis-global.org/org_regNum",

"value": "regNum"

}

    ],

    "active": true,

    "name": [

{

"family": "familyName",

"given": [

"givenName"

],

"prefix": [

"Dr"

]

}

    ],

    "telecom": [

{

"system": "phone"

},

{

"system": "email"

},

{

"system": "fax"

}

    ]

}

# Step 5:

Decide whether you want to add entities one by one, or commit them in one large
transaction.

## Step 5a: Add a Single Practitioner to Fhir place

In POSTman:

- select PUT operation
- Set address as the either the FHIR address or the OpenHIM address
  https://&lt;fhir or OpenHIM address>:&lt;port>/fhir/Practitioner/generated
  uuid
- Add Practitioner as the request body
- set Content-Type header to application/json
- execute the command

Alternatively use the FHIR UI:

- Navigate to https://&lt;fhir or OpenHIM address>:&lt;port>
- select Practitioner on the left hand list
- go to CRUD operation and do an UPDATE (NOT INSERT)
- Set the id as the generated uuid
- Execute the command

## Step 5b: Add Organization to Bundle

Template for the bundle is below. The entity in green represents a single entry
in the bundle. Multiple entries can be added as a comma delimited list.

{

"resourceType": "Bundle",

"id": "bundle-transaction",

"type": "transaction",

"entry": [

    {

      "resource":

    {Practitioner JSON here},

      "request": {

        "method": "PUT",

        "url": "Practitioner/generated uuid"

    }

}

]

}

Once your bundle contains all the entries you want you can execute the
transaction bundle

In POSTman:

- select POST operation
- Set address as https://&lt;fhir or OpenHIM address>:&lt;port>/fhir
- Add Bundle as the request body
- set Content-Type header to application/json
- execute the command

## Troubleshooting:

### No new doctors are being imported

- ensure the OpenELIS is configured to pull practitioners from the FhirStore: by
  setting in extra.properties:
  org.openelisglobal.providerlist.fhirstore=https://server-url:5000/fhir/
- ensure the configured endpoint is reachable from the OE server: telnet
  server-url 5000
- ensure the doctors name has no illegal characters. The supported characters
  are set in Admin > Field Validation Configuration under the firstNameCharset
  and lastNameCharset
- ensure the system is running the import procedure (by default, it runs on
  startup and every hour. The system can be restarted to trigger the import or
  by visiting the endpoint
  https://server-url:8443/OpenELIS-Global/import/provider
- check the logs to see if an unknown error is occurring and if you can't
  understand what is going wrong, escalate the problem.
