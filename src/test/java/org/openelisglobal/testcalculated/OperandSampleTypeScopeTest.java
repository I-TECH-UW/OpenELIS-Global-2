 * <p>
 * The builder has always stored the operand's specimen in {@code sampleId} — it
 * is the picker the user chooses the test from. {@code sampleTypeId} was added
 * beside it for the scoping work and is never written by the form, so an
 * executor reading only that saw NULL on every operand, treated each one as
 * unscoped, and fed the calculation with a result from any specimen the test
 * runs on. A calculation configured against Urines would run on a DBS result of
 * the same test.
