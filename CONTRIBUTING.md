The OpenELIS Global software is an open enterprise-level laboratory information
system built on open source web-based technologies that has been tailored for
low-and-middle income country public health laboratories. As you can guess, this
is not a one man role, but rather of a team of dedicated people around the world just like you.
To be part of this team, here are the guidelines.
