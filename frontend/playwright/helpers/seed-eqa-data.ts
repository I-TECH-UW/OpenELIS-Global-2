/**
 * EQA E2E seeding, shared by the EQA specs.
 *
 * Every seeder writes through `docker exec psql`, following the conventions
 * of seed-eqa-shipped-cycle.ts: guarded interpolation, organization ids that
 * fit a signed 32-bit int, and an undo stack so a seeder that fails half way
 * through unwinds instead of orphaning rows in a shared database.
 *
 * What each one sets up:
 *
 * - seedParticipantCycle: a scheme this lab is enrolled in plus a planned
 *   cycle — the starting state of the participant lane, which the spec then
 *   drives through Add Order, results and review.
 * - seedProviderScheme: a scheme this lab provides with five active
 *   participant enrollments and no cycle, since the wizard creates it. Its
 *   restore sweeps by scheme, so everything the run writes goes too.
 * - seedReportedResults: the score container, with one participant planted
 *   far enough from the pack to be unacceptable — which is what makes
 *   scoring enqueue a follow-up.
 * - seedFollowups: one follow-up about this lab and one about another, the
 *   whole of the split between the two registers.
 * - seedReceiptConditions: a dispatched cycle holding an overdue shipment
 *   and a damaged arrival, neither of which a healthy dispatch produces.
 * - seedOversightData: scored participant results and a competency event,
 *   which is what the three oversight dashboards read.
 * - seedInHousePanel: a distributed blinded panel, whose targets stay sealed.
 * - seedParticipantUser: a login without the provider grant, for the one
 *   spec that has to be someone other than an administrator.
