/**
 * EQA follow-up: the split between the two registers, and triage on each
 * (OGC-613).
 *
 * One scored cycle carries two follow-up rows — one about this laboratory,
 * one about another participant. Which page a row appears on is decided by
 * nothing more than that: rows about this lab are the participant's own
 * corrective work and belong to This Lab's Follow-Up, rows about other labs
 * are correspondence and belong to the provider register. Getting that
 * backwards would put another lab's failure into this lab's non-conformity
 * workflow, which is why both directions are asserted rather than one.
 *
 * Each page then gets its own triage action driven: the queue dismisses with
 * a category, the register records a response and resolves.
