/**
 * The first-generation EQA screens still on the menu (OGC-613).
 *
 * These predate the V2 provider and participant lanes and are not where new
 * work happens, but they are still routed, still reachable from the menu, and
 * still the only place some V1 data can be seen. A route that quietly stops
 * resolving — a lazy import renamed, a guard tightened, a path typo during a
 * menu change — presents as a blank page rather than an error, and nothing
 * else in the suite would notice.
 *
 * So this is a deliberately shallow spec: one landmark per route, asserting
 * the page mounted rather than exercising anything. Depth belongs with the V2
 * lanes, which is where it has been spent.
 */

/**
 * Landmarks are matched inside the main content region, never across the
 * whole page: the side navigation already contains words like "Participants"
 * and "EQA Distribution", so an unscoped search would let a blank routed page
 * pass on nav text — precisely the regression these checks exist to catch.
