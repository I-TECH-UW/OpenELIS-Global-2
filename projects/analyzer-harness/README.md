# Analyzer Harness

This directory now follows a single authoritative path for analyzer E2E parity.

## Authoritative Base (required for CI parity)

The analyzer harness CI gate runs from the repository root using:

- `projects/analyzer-harness/docker-compose.base.yml`
- `build.docker-compose.yml`
- `.github/ci/ci.analyzer-harness.yml`
- `.github/workflows/e2e-playwright-analyzer-harness-reusable.yml`

Use `ci-parity-test.sh` for exact local reproduction of that CI path.

```bash
./projects/analyzer-harness/ci-parity-test.sh
```

The script performs:

- strict preflight validation (no silent assumptions)
- exact CI step order (compose up, readiness, fixtures, seed, permissions,
  Playwright)
- deterministic evidence capture in `/tmp/oe-ci-parity-<timestamp>/`

## Startup Catalog

The authoritative harness startup catalog lives under
`projects/analyzer-harness/config-templates/`.

- CI mounts that directory directly into OE's startup configuration path.
- Local harness bootstrap copies that same directory into the harness volume.
- Do not add or update harness test catalog CSVs under any other source tree.

`seed-analyzers.sh` now hard-fails if the startup catalog cannot realize the
required profile mappings for the seeded analyzers.

## Local Compose Layers

Local harness startup now uses the same canonical service identities as CI, with
local-only overrides layered on top:

- `docker-compose.base.yml`
- `docker-compose.dev.yml`
- `docker-compose.analyzer-test.yml`
- `docker-compose.letsencrypt.yml`

These files must not drift behaviorally from the authoritative CI harness path
for critical analyzer flows.

## Development startup

```bash
scripts/dev-stack up
```

Run this from the repository root. It is the only supported interactive
development launcher and always starts core OpenELIS together with the analyzer
harness. It assigns worktree-specific Compose resources and random local ports.
Use `scripts/dev-stack env` to supply its URLs and analyzer network addresses to
Playwright.

The startup path does not execute SQL fixture loaders or use fixed primary keys.
It creates the analyzer harness scenarios idempotently through authenticated
application services. Feature-specific scenarios follow the same rule. CI parity
is a separate validation command because it intentionally reproduces CI
packaging.

To remove this worktree's data explicitly:

```bash
scripts/dev-stack down --volumes --yes
```

## Hot reload (after backend code changes)

The harness mounts `../../target/OpenELIS-Global.war` into the `oe.openelis.org`
container. After changing Java code, rebuild the WAR and **force-recreate** the
container (Tomcat caches the exploded WAR; a plain `restart` will serve stale
classes):

Re-run `scripts/dev-stack up`. The command rebuilds the WAR and recreates the
changed application services. Frontend changes hot-reload automatically.

## Resetting the test environment

For exact CI parity, prefer:

```bash
./projects/analyzer-harness/ci-parity-test.sh
```

`reset-env.sh` is retained only for legacy CI investigation. It is not a
development startup interface and must not be used to seed feature data.

## Let's Encrypt (analyzers.openelis-global.org)

The harness **shares the repo's Let's Encrypt certs**: it mounts
`../../volume/letsencrypt` (repo root), so valid certs generated per
**docs/LETSENCRYPT_SETUP.md** are used automatically.

Set the domain and email in the worktree's `.env`:

```bash
LETSENCRYPT_DOMAIN=analyzers.openelis-global.org
LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
```

Then run `scripts/dev-stack up`. Certificate issuance and the project-scoped
proxy restart are part of that same command.

## URLs

- UI: output of `scripts/dev-stack url`
- Backend API: `<scripts/dev-stack url>/api/`

Login (local-dev defaults only):

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `adminADMIN!`

> **Security note:** These credentials are for isolated local development only.
> Configure unique credentials for any shared or production deployment.

## Local volumes

This harness uses a local `./volume/` directory for:

- `./volume/analyzer-imports` → mounted at `/data/analyzer-imports`
- `./volume/plugins` → mounted at `/var/lib/openelis-global/plugins`
- logs under `./volume/logs/*`

## Notes

- HL7 analyzers are treated as **push-based** in OpenELIS; “Test Connection”
  will instruct you to validate by pushing an HL7 message to OpenELIS instead of
  attempting an outbound socket connection.
- ASTM TCP analyzers should target `openelis-analyzer-bridge:12001` (fixtures
  updated accordingly).
- RS232 analyzers use virtual ports under `/dev/serial/ttyVUSB0-4` (created by
  `virtual-serial` service).
